We describe a parameter study of galaxy formation simulations of an _L_[\u2217] galaxy that uses early stellar feedback combined with supernova feedback to match the stellar mass\u2013halo mass relationship. While supernova feedback alone can reduce star formation enough to match the stellar mass\u2013halo mass relationship, the galaxy forms too many stars before _z_ = 2 to match the evolution seen using abundance matching. Our early stellar feedback is purely thermal and thus operates like an ultraviolet ionization source as well as providing some additional pressure from the radiation of massive, young stars. The early feedback heats gas to _>_ 10[6] K before cooling it to 10[4] K. The pressure from this hot gas creates a more extended disc and prevents more star formation prior to _z_ = 1 than supernova feedback alone. The resulting disc galaxy has a flat rotation curve, an exponential surface brightness profile, and matches a wide range of disc scaling relationships",

In massive haloes, the gas reaches temperatures where its cooling time becomes longer than the Hubble time (Rees & Ostriker 1977), which results in a theoretical maximum galaxy mass. However, in the centres of galaxies, enough gas accumulates to increase the density to the point at which the gas efficiently radiates and cools. Such cooling is unstable since the radiation leaves through the optically thin surrounding hot gas",

This process leads to overcooling since as the hot gas cools, it stops providing pressure support to the surrounding gas, and more dense gas is able to accumulate and cool even more efficiently (White & Rees 1978). This problem is known as the \u2018overcooling catastrophe\u2019 (e.g. Balogh et al. 2001). The \u2018overcooling catastrophe\u2019 has long plagued simulations of disc galaxy formation.

One method is the abundance matching technique. To lay the groundwork for this technique, Conroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov (2006) rank ordered haloes by the total halo mass from collisionless simulations and then did rank ordering of galaxies based on their stellar masses from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The haloes and galaxies were then divided into several mass bins. Conroy et al. (2006) found that the correlation functions between haloes in certain mass bins were well matched by the correlation functions of galaxies in corresponding stellar mass bins. Several groups used this abundance matching technique to compare total halo masses with galaxy stellar masses (Conroy & Wechsler 2009; Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler 2010; Guo et al. 2010; Moster et al. 2010)",

Consequently, this low angular momentum material needs to be removed from the centre of the system.

Dutton & van den Bosch (2009) showed that stellar feedback can remove low angular momentum material. In hydrodynamical simulations, two methods are commonly used to model stellar feedback. One is kinetic feedback that adds velocity kicks to gas particles to remove them from the inner regions of galaxy discs (Springel & Hernquist 2003; Oppenheimer & Dav\u00b4e 2006; Dalla Vecchia & Schaye 2008)",

Since stars form in dense regions, the cooling times of the surrounding gas are short, and without help the gas will quickly radiate away all the SN energy (Katz 1992). In real galaxies, the amount of gas necessary to exert a dynamical influence on the interstellar medium (ISM) is small. In simulations, such small amount of gas is difficult to model, so a common technique has been developed to turn off cooling for a limited amount of time (Gerritsen & Icke 1997; Thacker & Couchman 2000; Brook et al. 2004; Stinson et al. 2006).

It is also possible that thermal feedback does not need to rely on disabling cooling. Dalla Vecchia & Schaye (2012) recently showed that thermal feedback can have a significant dynamical effect if the total energy of all the SN explosions is injected into one particle at one time.

Neither of these changes sufficiently limited star formation, so we turned to a source of energy that is often ignored in cosmological simulations, the luminosity emitted by massive stars before they explode as SNe. Hopkins et al. (2011) have shown that the inclusion of radiation pressure in high-resolution simulations can reduce star formation. The SN explosions in our previous simulations did not happen until 4 Myr after the formation of a stellar population. However, molecular clouds are disrupted much sooner than this, so the inclusion of this early stellar feedback (ESF) is necessary to reduce star formation before SNe start exploding",

These values correspond to a Jeans mass of _<_ 6000 M\u2299 and a Jeans length of _<_ 8 pc. Each of these values is far below both the gas particle mass, 2 \u00d7 10[5] M\u2299, and 310 pc softening length. In reality, this phase would become even denser, self-shielded and ultimately molecular, but we cannot resolve this process and must therefore estimate the star formation rate from the resolved dense gas. To avoid issues with Jeans fragmentation, a minimum pressure is established in the gas as described in Robertson & Kravtsov (2008).

Stellar lifetimes are based on the Padua lifetimes (Raiteri, Villata & Navarro 1996). Since the gas receiving the energy is dense, it would quickly be radiated away due to its efficient cooling.

A kinetic implementation of feedback requires many particles to represent a molecular cloud so that it can be torn apart.

The most striking effect of the thermal diffusion was that cold accretion filaments were heated and expanded. Cold blobs persisted in these simulations. Results of varying the thermal diffusion coefficient are presented in Section 3.

This would happen mostly as hot particles orbited around the disc and occasionally after particles had been ejected from the disc. Since the feedback is dependent on particles not cooling, we disabled thermal diffusion in interactions between particles in which either particle had its cooling shut off. We note that disabled cooling has the biggest effect in the dense disc. We find that less than 1 per cent of hot ( _T >_ 10[4] K) particles with their cooling disabled are outside the disc at _z_ = 0, and such particles are never found beyond 25 kpc at any time.

The scheme where all gas particles always diffused required a 75 per cent increase in _\u03f5_ ESF to limit the star formation to the stellar mass\u2013 halo mass relationship. The shape of the star formation history for the high-diffusion model is different. It increases throughout the history of the galaxy and begins to start a starburst over the last 1 Gyr. This shows how with too much thermal diffusion star formation acts as a positive feedback: the more stars form, the more gas cools enabling more star formation. The low thermal diffusion simulation (green) demonstrates a milder increase in star formation rate at the end of the simulation, but it remains above the fiducial value. An examination of the simulation reveals that this is due to cold gas clouds cooling out of the hot halo as described in Maller & Bullock (2004) and Kaufmann et al. (2009)",

The star formation history of the fiducial simulation compares well to the star formation history of the Milky Way, though such studies have necessarily focused on the solar neighbourhood (Rocha-Pinto & Maciel 1997; Rocha-Pinto et al. 2000; Hernandez, Valls-Gabaud & Gilmore 2000; Cignoni et al. 2006). These studies find that the solar neighbourhood has a mostly flat star formation rate with factors of a few variations and a peak at _z_ \u223c 1. Looking at nearby dwarf galaxies, Weisz et al.

The no ESF simulation also evolves to an equipartition between the three baryonic phases: stars, hot gas and cold gas. It appears that the other simulations are converging to this equipartition, but it is hard to predict whether the stars will reach the same value as hot and cold gas.

The greatest difference seems to be in the galaxy centres; the simulations with ESF have flat rotation curves while those without ESF have central peaks. To examine this, Fig. 12 compares the evolution of the inner 2 kpc of the fiducial simulation with the 120 per cent SN energy simulation. In Fig. 9, it is shown that the **Figure 12.** The evolution of the inner 2 kpc of the stars and gas in the simulation for the fiducial (red) and 120 per cent SN energy (cyan) models.

Fig. 12 also shows that the higher star formation follows the higher mass of cold gas in the central region of the 120 per cent SN energy simulation. So, there is a clear difference in the cold gas and star formation inside the inner 2 kpc of the two simulations. What is causing the difference in cold gas in the centre? There are several possibilities. - (i) Cold gas is more efficiently ejected from the ESF simulation. - (ii) Cold gas is replaced by hot gas in the inner 2 kpc. (iii) The increased thermal pressure supports the gas at distances from the centre of the galaxy further than 2 kpc",

Rather than the ESF simulation more efficiently ejecting gas, a look at the evolution of the galaxies[2] shows that the 120 per cent SN energy ejects gas at higher velocity and to larger radii than the ESF simulation. The stronger gas ejection from the 120 per cent SN energy simulation is also apparent in the star formation history. The simulations without ESF have less star formation after _z_ \u223c 1 than those with ESF because they have less gas remaining in the central region.

It is also necessary for stellar feedback to create a warm component of the ISM. That said, the fiducial simulation exhibits the same angular momentum distribution described in Brook et al.

Our fiducial model best fits the stellar mass\u2013halo mass relationship; the evolution of this relationship has a flat rotation curve and an exponential surface brightness profile with a modest bulge in the centre. In contrast to many previous cosmological galaxy formation simulations, most of the star formation occurs after _z_ = 2. There are two peaks of star formation that correspond to the two significant mergers to the galaxy. Both of these mergers are gas rich. We find that the mass of stars formed at _z_ = 0 is very sensitive to the amount and timing of stellar feedback employed. Models that form too many stars follow a common pattern where they turn half of their baryons into stars, the other half is hot gas.

INTRODUCTION Constraining the buildup of stellar mass in galaxies provides fundamental constraints on galaxy formation models. An ever growing number of galaxy observations have been made, covering a time period from 500 Myr after the big bang (e.g., Zheng et al. 2012) to the present day. A model of galaxy formation that can match observations over this entire stretch of time would represent a significant aid to our understanding. So far, matching the evolution of the stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies over this entire epoch with has proved difficult (see, e.g., Lu et al. 2012; Borgani & Kravtsov 2011; Weinmann et al. 2012)",

Despite challenges of reproducing these observations with detailed models of galaxy formation, significant progress has been made in recent years with empirical models that connect the evolution of galaxy properties to the evolution of dark matter halos. Over the past decade, a range of studies have associated galaxies with dark matter halos at a given epoch, using a variety of techniques, including Halo Occupation Distribution modeling (e.g., Berlind & Weinberg 2002; Bullock et al. 2002) the Conditional Luminosity Function modeling (e.g., Yang et al. 2003), and variants of the abundance matching technique (e.g., Col\u00b4\u0131n et al. 1999; Kravtsov & Klypin 1999; Neyrinck et al. 2004; Kravtsov et al. 2004; Vale & Ostriker 2004, 2006; Tasitsiomi et al. 2004; Conroy et al. 2006; Shankar et al. 2006; Berrier et al. 2006; Mar\u00b4\u0131n et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2010; Moster et al. 2010; Behroozi et al. 2010)",

The simplest abundance matching models assign the most massive observed galaxies in rank order to the largest halos in an equal simulation volume. With only slight modifications (e.g., using the peak mass for satellite halos), this technique accurately reproduces the redshift\u2014and scale-dependent clustering of galaxies (e.g., Conroy et al. 2006; Reddick et al. 2012). Because the cosmological model provides a prediction for the buildup of dark matter halos, one can combine knowledge of the galaxy-halo connection at different epochs with knowledge of the mass accretion and merger histories of halos to constrain the buildup of stellar mass in galaxies over cosmic time. This was first done in a comprehensive way by Conroy & Wechsler (2009), who provided an empirical constraint on the star formation histories (SFHs) and stellar mass growth in galaxies from _z_ = 2 to the present",

These studies represented important advances, albeit with shortcomings. For example, most of these studies only modeled galaxy evolution from _z_ \u223c 2 to the present due to perceived conflicts between the integrated cosmic star formation and the cosmic stellar mass density at _z >_ 1 (Wilkins et al. 2008; Hopkins & Beacom 2006). In addition, because passive stellar mass loss (e.g., supernovae of massive stars) depends on galaxies\u2019 SFHs, these studies had to make assumptions about the ages of stars already formed at _z >_ 2",

Here we present a new technique and a new compilation of observations, aimed squarely at resolving these issues. On the observational side, new observations of galaxies at very high redshifts (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2011, 2012; Bradley et al. 2012; McLure et al. 2011) have made it possible to place constraints on galaxy formation all the way to _z_ \u223c 8. At lower redshifts, we present the first constraints from stellar mass functions (SMFs) based on the PRIMUS survey, as well as from a new analysis at _z_ = 0 based on Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and _GALEX_ data (Moustakas et al. 2013).

The redshift evolution of this relation is due to three contributing physical effects for stars in galaxies (new star formation, merging satellite galaxies, and stellar mass loss) and one effect for halos (continuing mass accretion). Merging galaxies and mass accretion are well-constrained by dark matter simulations, and stellar mass loss is well-constrained with the assumption of an IMF for stars. The most uncertain of these effects, in relation to dark matter halos, are new star formation and stars ejected during galaxy mergers. With observational constraints on the redshift evolution of the stellar mass and the SFR as well as computed constraints on satellite mass loss, we may effectively constrain both of these factors",

Our approach is to flexibly parameterize the possibilities for the SMHM relation, _M_ \u2217( _Mh, z_ ), as well as the uncertainties affecting the remaining terms in Equation (1). Then, using a MCMC method, we can determine the allowed parameter space for _M_ \u2217( _Mh, z_ ) by comparing the implied SFRs and stellar mass abundances to observations across a wide range of redshifts. Parameterizing _M_ \u2217( _Mh, z_ ) separately for individual halos is beyond the scope of this work (although it will be explored in future papers)",

By taking a summation of Equation (1) over halos in a specific mass and redshift bin, we can derive the total amount of stars formed in that bin. Thus, dividing by the number of halos in that bin gives the _average_ SFR, which is similar to approaches taken in previous works (Conroy & Wechsler 2009; Leitner 2012; Wang et al. 2013; Moster et al. 2013). This approach is accurate except in terms of small second-order effects that come from different stellar mass histories having a range of stellar mass loss rates.

OBSERVATIONAL CONSTRAINTS AND UNCERTAINTIES We use three types of observational constraints on star formation in galaxies: the SMF, the SSFR of galaxies (star formation rate per unit stellar mass), and the CSFR. SMFs are discussed in Section 3.1, CSFRs are discussed in Section 3.3, and SSFRs are discussed in Section 3.2. To ensure a fair comparison between the different data sets, we convert each measurement to the same set of systematic assumptions. For the IMF, we convert all results to that of Chabrier (2003). We do not consider evolving IMFs, nor do we consider the uncertainties for a non-universal IMF, as both uncertainties are beyond the scope of this paper",

These are shown in Table 3. Different observational challenges present themselves in each redshift range. At low redshifts, the statistics are sufficient that systematic errors in calculating stellar masses are the largest source of uncertainty (Behroozi et al. 2010).

One possible explanation is an evolving or a non-universal IMF; a number of different lines of evidence exist in support of this theory (e.g., van Dokkum & Conroy 2010; Lucatello et al. 2005; Tumlinson 2007a, 2007b; van Dokkum 2008). Another possible reason is that star formation at high redshift could be bursty or dust-obscured, yielding an incomplete census of galaxies in Lyman-break surveys (Lee et al. 2009; Stark et al. 2009).

In our analysis of recent CSFR literature (Section 3.2), we find that newer estimates of the CSFR are systematically lower at _z >_ 3 than the data in Hopkins & Beacom (2006; see Figure 2). A similar conclusion is reached in Bernardi et al. (2010) and Moster et al. (2013). In addition, deep probes of the SMF at lower redshifts ( _z <_ 1 _._ 5) have resulted in findings of steep faint-end slopes (Baldry et al. 2008; Drory et al. 2009; Mortlock et al. 2011).

Specific Star Formation Rates_ We conducted a literature survey in an almost identical manner as for the CSFR to assemble a collection of SSFR constraints as a function of stellar mass, again in 2012 October (see",

The selected papers are summarized in Table 5. Most authors do not consider the full range of systematics that could affect their stellar masses or SFR estimates. To account for this we take a similar approach as in Section 3.2 and estimate systematic errors by calculating interpublication variances. Details of our approach are given in Appendix F",

We did not find evidence for mass or redshift trends in the variance, and have adopted a uniform systematic uncertainty of 0.28 dex for SSFRs. Besides these observational constraints, we apply one modeling constraint to SFRs in high-mass halos at low redshifts. The slope of the SMHM relationship flattens toward high halo masses (Behroozi et al. 2010; Moster et al. 2010), meaning that central galaxy stellar mass becomes a poor indicator of the host halo mass. Consequently, observed SSFRs (reported as functions of stellar mass) offer poor constraints on the SFR of high-mass halos. Nonetheless, observations of galaxy clusters have indicated that the central galaxies generally have very low SFRs (e.g., Donahue et al. 2010; Rawle et al. 2012). To account for this we apply a weak prior based on the Wetzel et al. (2012) group catalog",

These cosmological parameters are consistent with results from both _WMAP_ 5 (Komatsu et al. 2009) and the latest _WMAP_ 7+BAO+H0 results (Komatsu et al. 2011). Halos in Bolshoi were identified using Rockstar, a sevendimensional halo finder that uses phase space plus temporal information (Behroozi et al. 2013b). Merger trees were generated using a new algorithm presented in Behroozi et al. (2013c), which enforces physically consistent evolution of halo properties across timesteps to provide increased robustness against anomalies in the halo finder. Halo masses are calculated using spherical overdensities, according to the virial overdensity criterion of Bryan & Norman (1998)",

This rate of decrease is different for different halo masses. At moderate to high redshifts ( _z >_ 2), larger halo masses generically have larger average SFRs. However, at lower redshifts, the highest mass halos ( _Mh_ \u2273 10[14] _M_ \u2299) become so inefficient that they have lower SFRs than group-scale (10[13] _M_ \u2299) halos or Milky-Way sized (10[12] _M_ \u2299) halos",

These have been the subject of recent interest due to the finding of higher-thanexpected stellar mass to halo mass ratios in dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2012). However, these expectations have been set largely by the assumption that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio remains a scale-free power law below 10[11] _M_ \u2299. As seen in Figure 7, the low mass power-law behavior is broken below 10[11] _M_ \u2299, corresponding with an upturn in the SMF below 10[8] _[.]_[5] _M_ \u2299 (Baldry et al. 2008; this result has also been seen by A.

If enough color bands are available to avoid degeneracies with other fitting parameters, observers may consider adding the possibility of recent starbursts to their models to account for the fact that they can significantly alter observed galaxy colors. The next reason for deviations is sustained deficits in the SFR for satellite galaxies compared to field galaxies (e.g., Wetzel et al. 2012).

At lower redshifts, the observation that satellites cease to form stars relatively quickly after accretion (Wetzel et al. 2012) means that declining SFHs may continue to be reasonable fits for satellite galaxies, even though most other galaxies of the same mass may be better fit by rising SFHs.

We discuss effects from both a distribution in SFRs for galaxies at a given halo mass and from a distribution of halo mass accretion histories. Bimodality has been observed in the SFRs of galaxies at fixed stellar mass, partially but not exclusively driven by quenched satellite galaxies (see, e.g., Wetzel et al. 2012). This may appear to be a problem for our method because the rate of specific mass loss (see Section 2.3) will be different depending on whether a given galaxy is active or passive. Remarkably, however, our method is robust to any distribution of SFRs in galaxies of the same stellar mass",

        "text": ". Because our method only depends on the _total_ stellar mass buildup in halos of a given mass _Mh_ at any given time, the fact that some galaxies get a larger share of that buildup than others is not a concern. If certain galaxies sustain a higher growth rate for a long time, then the _scatter_ in stellar mass at fixed halo mass will certainly increase; however, the possibility of scatter changing with time is an effect that we include explicitly in our model. Bimodality in SFRs is only a problem if it results in a distribution of _stellar masses_ at fixed halo mass that cannot be reasonably modeled by a log-normal distribution (i.e., the distribution we assume in this work). So far, no evidence has emerged for any other distribution to be preferred (see comments in Section 2.2.1 where _\u03be_ is defined). There is more possibility for error because we do not account for correlations between the SFH and the mass accretion history of a halo",

It is worth working through a more quantitative example to verify this assertion. Consider a population of galaxies all with the same stellar mass _M_ \u2217 = 10[10] _M_ \u2299 today. Assume that each galaxy has had a constant SSFR for its entire lifetime (i.e., an exponential growth history), and moreover that the distribution of the SSFRs is log-normal with width 0.3 dex (similar to that seen in Salim et al. 2007) and median 10[\u2212][9] yr[\u2212][1]",

At every timestep, we calculate the number of halos that transition between one mass bin and another ( _Tt,mmpn_[), i.e., the number of halos that had a mass] _[ m] p_[at timestep] _[ t]_[ and a mass] _[ m] n_[at timestep] _[ t]_[ + 1] (see Appendices G and H)",

To convert Equation (1) into a full tensor equation, we need a small amount of additional notation. The stellar mass at a particular timestep _t_ and halo mass _m_ becomes SM _t,m_ , the SFR at a particular timestep and halo mass becomes SFR _t,m_ , and the number counts at a given timestep for halos in a given mass bin becomes _Nt,m_ . In addition, we denote the difference in stellar mass from the previous timestep by \u0394SM _t,m_ .

To account for the presence of scatter in observed stellar mass at fixed halo mass, we use a method based on Richardson\u2013Lucy deconvolution to extract the median stellar mass as a function of halo mass. We assume a combined scatter of 0.2 dex. The deconvolved SMHM relation is shown in Figure 20. The figure demonstrates that a double power-law can approximate the relation, but can be discrepant by up to 0.1 dex.

Special caution is necessary when using a MCMC method where a parameterization to tightly constrained data is accompanied by additional systematic or nuisance parameters. This is because the MCMC method may try to recruit the additional parameters to improve the fit, rather than for their intended purpose (i.e., to cover the range of allowed uncertainties).

The halo mass at which the integrated star formation is most efficient rises by 0.5 dex from 10[12] _M_ \u2299 at _z_ = 0 to 10[12] _[.]_[5] _M_ \u2299 at _z_ = 2. 3. Above _z_ = 2 it is difficult to locate the halo mass at which the peak integrated efficiency occurs because surveys at high redshifts do not have sufficient volume to probe the exponential tail of the SMF (if one exists)",

There appears to be a turnaround in the SMHM relation near _z_ \u223c 2. The integrated efficiency of _Mh_ \u223c 10[11] _[.]_[5] _M_ \u2299 halos falls from _z_ = 0 to _z_ = 2, but then increases at higher redshifts. At high redshifts, it is difficult to tell what, if any, evolution there is in the shape of the SMHM relation. However, it is clear that either the efficiency or the characteristic halo mass scale is evolving. If we constrain the shape parameters in our fitting formula for the SMHM relation ( _\u03b1, \u03b4,_ and _\u03b3_ ) to the _z_ = 0 values, we find that high redshifts strongly prefer a halo mass scale that scales as a power law with redshift, but have comparatively little implied evolution in the efficiency at high redshifts",

Excluding high-redshift bins ( _z >_ 3), there are no obvious systematic trends in the interpublication variance, either with redshift or stellar mass.

Letting _Mh_ be the mass of the host halo and _\u03b8_ be the ratio of subhalo peak mass to host mass, we find that the disruption rate (expressed in terms of the decrement in number of subhalos per unit host halo per unit redshift per log interval in subhalo mass ratio) is If _\u03b8_ is instead the ratio of subhalo accretion mass to host halo mass, we find instead a slightly simpler dependence: We show the quality of the fits for the peak subhalo mass in Figure 26. For ease of comparing simulation data to the fit, we have scaled out host mass and redshift dependencies according to Equations (I1)\u2013(I3), so that all plotted lines are directly comparable to the subhalo disruption rate for _M_ = 10[12] _M_ \u2299 at _z_ = 0. Figure 26 shows that scaling in both mass and redshift of the subhalo disruption rate has been successfully captured in Equations (I1)\u2013(I3)",

Comparisons with observed data are presented in Figure 27. For ease of comparison across mass ranges, we show comparisons between derived baryon conversion efficiencies and stellar mass histories for the main model in this paper and the alternate models in Figures 28 and 29. First, it may be verified that the model including no systematics succeeds remarkably well in matching all three kinds of observations; while it is potentially somewhat high at low redshifts for the CSFR, this is not unexpected on account of issues with the galaxy _/_ ICL definition (Section 2.4)",

The No Systematics model has much tighter error bars on the stellar mass to halo mass ratios (not shown) than the full model at all redshifts, which suggests that systematics remain the single largest source of errors in determining stellar masses. Figure 28 is comparable to Figure 5 for the No Systematics model, except that at high redshifts and low halo masses, there is an upturn in the SFR that is not present in the full model. The model excluding _z >_ 6 data gives almost identical results as the full model for _z_ \u2a7d 6, which is encouraging. The \u201cpredictions\u201d for high-redshift SMFs are somewhat lower than in the best-fitting model, which results in a higher SFR (i.e., rate of stellar mass growth) over the period from _z_ \u223c 7 to _z_ \u223c 6. The model excluding all cosmic star formation constraints is remarkably similar to the full model in our analysis. This is as expected: the specific SFR in combination with the SMF gives a constraint on the total amount of star formation",

Yet, the CSFR data has tighter error bars than the SSFR in combination with the SMF, at least for _z <_ 1 (see Sections 3.2 and 3.3), so it provides slightly better constraints at those redshifts. Excluding all SFR data results in a good fit to the CSFR at high redshifts, where growth in stellar mass is rapid\u2014i.e., where SMFs at successive redshifts are significantly different even despite large errors. At lower redshifts, the predicted CSFR for the best-fitting model is discrepant from observations. At these redshifts, the growth in stellar mass is poorly constrained because the intrinsic SMFs are changing comparatively little, especially from _z_ = 0 _._ 5 to _z_ = 0. A small difference in the choice of SMF evolution at low redshifts therefore has a much larger impact on the relative error in SFRs",

From the best-fitting model results, together with direct observables such as morphology, colour, and the Mg _b_ /\u27e8Fe\u27e9 index ratio measured within 1 _R_ e, we find that for central galaxies both their stellar and halo masses have a significant influence in their evolution. For a given halo mass, galaxies with higher stellar mass accumulate their stellar mass and become chemically enriched earlier than those with smaller stellar mass. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, galaxies living in more massive haloes have longer star formation time-scales and are delayed in becoming chemically enriched. In contrast, the evolution of massive satellite galaxies is mostly determined by their stellar mass. The results indicate that both the assembled halo mass and the halo assembly history impact the evolution of central galaxies. Our spatially resolved analysis indicates that only the galaxy properties in the central region (0.0\u20130.5 _R_ e) show the dependencies described above",

It is thus perhaps unsurprising that a galaxy\u2019s evolution would correlate, to first-order, with the growth of the dark matter halo (e.g. White & Rees 1978; Blumenthal et al. 1984). The formation and evolution of dark matter haloes are mainly driven by gravitational forces, which are relatively well understood through large _N_ -body simulations (e.g. Springel et al. 2005). Yet, galaxies are complex systems not regulated by dark matter alone; they are also affected by a variety of baryonic processes",

It is therefore very important to investigate, simultaneously, how the physical properties of galaxies and their evolution are driven by their dark matter haloes (i.e. the galaxy\u2013halo connection), together with their dependence on physical properties connected with the baryonic physics. Searching for a link between the evolution of galaxies and their host dark matter haloes has been challenging because the properties of the dark matter haloes are often not directly observable. It has long been known that galaxies in high-density regions such as groups and clusters are more likely to be red and dead (e.g. Oemler 1974; > _\u22c6_ E-mail: alfonso.aragon@nottingham.ac.uk (AA-S); shuang.zhou@inaf.it (SZ) Dressler 1980; Postman & Geller 1984).

For massive galaxies, however, being a central or satellite galaxy does not seem to alter their evolution paths. The consensus from a number of recent investigations is that the stellar populations of massive galaxies are largely determined by internal galaxy properties rather than the environment, which is related to the properties of their haloes (e.g. Peng et al. 2012; Greene et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2022b). Results from large surveys such as SDSS also reveal that, of all the internal galaxy properties that may drive the evolution of massive galaxies, their stellar mass and/or central velocity dispersion are likely to be the most important ones",

Similar conclusions are reached by the work of Oyarz\u00b4un et al. (2022), in which integral field unit (IFU) data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey are used to assert the influence of halo mass on stellar populations of passive central galaxies. From simulations, Wang, Wang & Chen (2023) find that central galaxies in more massive haloes have lower gas-phase metallicity at high redshift than those in low-mass haloes due to the long-lasting accretion of lowmetallicity gas. Such an effect is used to explain the low metallicity of cluster galaxies found at high redshift (e.g. Wang et al. 2022)",

However, most of these studies are based on simple age or metallicity averages and are limited to single-fibre observation or specific types of galaxies. A full description of the spatially resolved past history of a large and well-defined sample of galaxies will provide key information on how galaxy halo and stellar masses shaped their evolution. Fortunately, we are now in a position to investigate these physical processes in more detail. In recent work (Zhou, Merrifield & Arag\u00b4onSalamanca 2022a, hereafter Paper I), we have shown that it is possible to go beyond the simple averaged age/metallicity to reach a full description of the stellar mass accumulation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies using a \u2018semi-analytic\u2019 spectral fitting approach",

We then investigate the inferred evolutionary parameters and their correlation with galaxy and halo properties in Section 4. Finally, we summarize our key results in Section 5.

In this section, we give a brief introduction to the survey and then describe our sample selection and data reduction processes. ## **2.1 MaNGA** MaNGA was part of the SDSS-IV (Blanton et al. 2017). This survey provided spatially resolved high-quality spectroscopy data for over 10 000 nearby (redshift 0.01 _< z <_ 0.15) galaxies (Yan et al. 2016b), covering the stellar mass range 5 \u00d7 10[8] \u2264 _M_ \u2217 \u2264 3 \u00d7 10[11] _h_[\u2212][2] M\u2299 (Wake et al. 2017). The MaNGA IFU covers at least 1.5 effective radii for all the target galaxies (Law et al. 2015). The spectra were obtained with the two dual-channel Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey spectrographs (Smee et al. 2013) mounted on the Sloan 2.5-m telescope (Gunn et al",

MaNGA used a Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP; Law et al. 2016) to produce science-ready spectra with flux calibration better than 5 per cent across most of the wavelength range (Yan et al. 2016a). In addition, a Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP; Belfiore et al. 2019; Westfall et al. 2019) was used to process these reduced data, providing various useful data products including stellar kinematics, emission-line properties, and spectral indices. Moreover, the MaNGA collaboration has carried out very extensive analysis and research with the data, and some of the outputs of that work have been released as valueadded catalogues (VACs); we will make use of a number of these results in this paper. ## **2.2 Sample selection and data preparation** We start from the parent sample of disc galaxies defined in Paper I",

To obtain the group properties of these galaxies, we cross-match this sample with the group catalogue of Yang et al. (2007), from which we identify massive central and satellite galaxies, as well as the group halo masses of these galaxies. To avoid the most extreme environmental effects, we limit our investigation to galaxies in groups and not clusters. Hence, the host halo masses are selected to be \u227210[13] _[.]_[5] M\u2299.

In this work, we intend to investigate both the global and spatially resolved properties of the galaxies. To this end, we perform two types of stacking. For the global properties, we use all the spaxels within 1 _R_ e, with _R_ e being the effective radius of each galaxy. This achieves sufficient SNR to calculate the galaxies\u2019 integrated properties with a high degree of confidence. To investigate the stellar population properties in a spatially resolve way, we need to reach a compromise between the required SNR and spatial resolution. This is achieved by dividing each galaxy into two regions: an inner region within 0.5 _R_ e, and outer region from 0.5 _R_ e to 1.5 _R_ e, stacking the spaxels within each radial range.

This approach introduces a simple but flexible chemical evolution model to characterize the stellar mass accumulation and ChEH of galaxies, which are combined with stellar population synthesis to produce model spectra that can be directly compared with observations. The model catches the main physical processes involved in galaxy evolution, and it is designed to be simple but flexible enough to produce model spectra that fit most kinds of galaxies.

Taking into account all these processes, the gas mass evolution of a galaxy can be modelled with the following equation: The first term on the right-hand side represents how the gas falls into the galaxy.

What is new here is that our results show that \u2018downsizing\u2019 still exists even if we control for halo masses; in other words, we conclude that \u2018downsizing\u2019 is not solely driven by halo mass evolution, but some internal baryonic process \u2013 linked with stellar mass \u2013 also play a role.

It has thus long been proposed that, as the main parameter that determines the evolution of a dark matter halo, its mass may also drive the growth and evolution of the galaxy at its centre (e.g. White & Rees 1978; Blumenthal et al. 1984; Mo et al. 1998). Indeed, we do observe a correlation between halo mass and the stellar population properties of central galaxies even when the stellar mass of the galaxy is controlled for; when considering galaxies of similar stellar mass, those with higher halo masses tend to be late in their chemical enrichment and thus have lower averaged stellar metallicity, and they also have more recent star formation activity. There are several possible physical processes that may be causing such trends. A natural explanation is that, at fixed stellar mass, more massive haloes are more efficient at feeding gas into their central galaxy",

In addition, the long-lasting gas infall provides material for more recent star formation. Such a scenario is supported by simulations. Wang et al. (2023) found from the EAGLE (Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments) simulations that, at a given stellar mass, the ISM fraction of central galaxies in more massive dark matter haloes at high redshift is generally higher than that in less massive ones. Our best-fitting model results suggest longer gas infall time-scales in high-_M_ h galaxies, which is also evidence of more efficient gas accretion. Alternatively, it is thought that in these massive galaxies AGN feedback can play an important role (e.g. Croton et al. 2006; Sijacki et al. 2007) in shaping their evolution. Strong AGN feedback can remove metal-enriched gas from the galaxy and suppress its chemical enrichment",

At a given halo mass, galaxies with higher stellar masses tend to be more metal-rich and host older stellar populations. However, in the current galaxy formation framework, a galaxy\u2019s growth history ought to be ultimately tied to the formation and evolution of its dark matter halo.

However, it is often hard to infer the properties of dark matter haloes beyond their mass, nor to correlate them with stellar population properties such as age and metallicity, as dark matter haloes cannot be observed directly. In these circumstances, people often seek solutions using semianalytic models or hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation and evolution, trying to find other halo properties that may possibly be linked to the galaxies\u2019 stellar populations. Promising progress along these lines has been made by Croton, Gao & White (2007), who found from semi-analytic models that the halo formation time correlates with galaxy luminosity at fixed halo mass. Since then, various hydrodynamic simulations and other semi-analytical models have confirmed that, at fixed halo mass, earlier formed haloes host more massive galaxies than later formed ones (e.g. Wang et al. 2013; Zehavi et al. 2018; Martizzi et al. 2020)",

In combination with the shorter gas infall timescales obtained through our semi-analytic spectral fitting approach (see Fig. 5), we can naturally speculate that these galaxies reside within dark matter haloes that formed systematically earlier than their low stellar mass counterparts. In addition, the spatially resolved results shown in Fig. 7 provide further evidence for such a scenario: galaxies that have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratio formed half of their stellar masses earlier as indicated by _t_ 50, but this effect is only prominent in the central region of the galaxies. In the outer parts, there is little evidence that _t_ 50 correlates with either stellar mass or halo mass",

As stars in the central regions of these massive galaxies are generally older than those in the outer parts, this result indicates that it is those old stars the ones keeping memory of their dark matter halo formation process. The late-formed stars in the outer parts do not know much about the time the halo formed since the halo formation had almost finished several Gyr before their formation. Therefore, the properties of the stars in the outer regions show no correlation with either halo mass or halo formation time. It is worth pointing out that, since both the gas infall and star formation time-scales are not linked to the halo formation time-scales in a straightforward way, future research that includes detailed hydrodynamic simulations is needed to provide more direct physical insights",

We selected central galaxies as the most massive members of their group. A sample of satellite galaxies with similar stellar masses was also selected for comparison. For each galaxy, we combine the spectral data within 1 _R_ e to create a high SNR spectrum representing its global properties. Data inside the 0.0\u20130.5 _R_ e and 0.5\u20131.5 _R_ e regions are also combined to characterize the stellar populations in the central and outer regions of the galaxy. We applied a semi-analytic spectral fitting approach to the combined data to obtain key physical properties of the galaxies. This approach produces the star formation and ChEHs from the galaxies\u2019 data and also determines physical parameters related to gas accretion and outflows, which are key components of the models",

From the best-fitting model results, as well as from direct observables such as morphologies, NUV \u2212 _r_ colours, and Mg _b_ /\u27e8Fe\u27e9 index ratios, we obtained the following results. (i) We confirm the canonical \u2018downsizing\u2019 formation scenario in which more massive galaxies tend to accumulate their stellar mass and become chemically enriched earlier than less massive ones. This effect holds even when the mass of the dark matter halo is controlled for. (ii) In addition to the stellar mass, halo mass is also found to have a significant impact on the stellar population properties of the galaxies. At fixed stellar mass, galaxies in low-mass haloes are found to be more metal enriched and finish star formation earlier than those in more massive haloes.

All these results confirm the correlations with stellar and halo mass described above. (iv) The halo mass of the host group/cluster is found to have little impact on the evolution of massive satellite galaxies at a given stellar mass. Instead, the evolution of massive satellite galaxies is mainly driven by their stellar masses. (v) Using spatially resolved data from the inner and outer regions of the galaxies, we find that only the properties of the central regions have a dependence on halo mass. The outer regions of the galaxies seem to know little about the properties of their haloes. Based on these results, we discuss the possible physical origins of the dependencies we find",

This gas inflow also dilutes the chemical composition of the ISM in these galaxies, slowing down their chemical enrichment. At a given halo mass, a galaxy with higher stellar mass may live in a halo formed earlier, so that their star formation activity also quenches earlier. These simple physical ideas, backed by more sophisticated hydrodynamic and semi-analytic galaxy evolution models, are able to explain the trends we observe. ## **ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS** SZ, AA-S, and MM acknowledge financial support from the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC; grant no.

INTRODUCTION** In modern cosmological models, \u223c5/6 of the mass in the Universe is made of dark matter (Planck Collab. et al. 2016). This dark matter forms the skeleton on which galaxies form, evolve, and merge. In the context of this model, which is now well established from a wide range of observations, fluctuations in the matter distribution were created in the first fraction of a second during an inflationary period. Gravitational instability grew these fluctuations over time",

Gas and dark matter were initially well mixed; as the Universe evolved, gas was able to dissipate and fell to the centers of dark matter halos. For large enough dark matter halos, gas was able to cool, form stars, and form a protogalaxy. The power spectrum of matter indicates that small objects should form first, and halos should grow and merge over time. Galaxies within these halos then continue to form stars (in situ) as well as to grow through merging (ex situ), because their dark matter halos merge. Energetic processes within galaxies impact their surroundings after they form, as various kinds of feedback, which influences future gas accretion and star formation. In this context, clearly the growth, internal properties, and spatial distribution of galaxies are likely to be closely connected to the growth, internal properties, and spatial distribution of dark matter halos",

For example, Peebles (1980) discussed the two-point statistics of galaxies, and early work recognized that massive galaxies and clusters should have different clustering properties than average galaxies (Bahcall & Soneira 1983, Davis & Peebles 1983, Klypin & Kopylov 1983, Kaiser 1984), and that measuring these clustering properties could provide information about the masses of the dark matter halos that they lived in, because of the strong dependence of halo clustering on halo mass (Bardeen et al. 1986, Mo & White 1996). It also was recognized early on that this relationship could be complex and scale dependent (e.g., Klypin et al. 1996, Jenkins et al. 1998).

(1999) were able to resolve substructures in simulations of cosmological volumes, and they measured approximately power-law correlation functions that were consistent with measurements from APM. This field was then revolutionized with the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS; Colless et al. 2001) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000).

The halo model can be combined with models of the galaxy\u2013halo connection to predict galaxy clustering.

MODELS OF THE GALAXY\u2013HALO CONNECTION** In this review, we distinguish between two basic approaches to modeling the galaxy\u2013halo connection: empirical modeling, which uses data to constrain a specific set of parameters describing the connection at a given epoch or as a function of time, and physical modeling, which either directly simulates or parameterizes the physics of galaxy formation such as gas cooling, star formation, and feedback. A schematic summary of these approaches to the galaxy\u2013halo connection is given in **Figure 1** , which gives an example of the galaxy and dark matter distributions for one such model, and outlines the key elements of various approaches",

This basic approach is generally called abundance matching in the literature (the most massive galaxy lives in the most massive halo; the second most massive galaxy lives in the next most massive halo, etc.) The earliest versions of this assumption, applied before there were robust simulations that resolved cosmological structure within halos, assumed only one galaxy per halo (e.g., Wechsler et al. 1998, Col\u00b4\u0131n et al. 1999, Kravtsov & Klypin 1999, Moustakas & Somerville 2002). However, CDM predicts structure on all scales, and thus predicts that dark matter halos host distinct substructures. These substructures (above a certain mass) are expected to host galaxies. A simple ansatz is thus that each halo and subhalo hosts a galaxy, with the mass or luminosity of a galaxy matched by abundance to the mass or velocity of the dark matter (sub)halo in which it lives; this is often referred to as subhalo abundance matching (SHAM) in the literature (Kravtsov et al. 2004, Tasitsiomi et al",

Although the earliest versions of these models were sometimes referred to as zero parameter models, there are in fact a set of assumptions or parameters that need to be specified. The two most important are the following: ( _a_ ) Which halo property is best matched to which galaxy property?, and ( _b_ ) What is the scatter between these properties? It was realized quickly that while subhalos are rapidly stripped of their outer material after being accreted into a larger dark matter halo, galaxy stripping starts much later (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005). Thus one might expect a model that matches galaxies to halo properties at the time they are accreted into their host halos to provide a better match to a luminosity-selected galaxy sample; this was demonstrated by Conroy et al. (2006)",

This maximum galaxy-formation efficiency occurs around the mass of halos hosting typical _L_ \u2217 galaxies like the Milky Way, around 10[12] M\u2299; we refer to this as the pivot mass. At higher and lower masses, galaxy formation is even less efficient. Roughly, the stellar mass of central galaxies scales as _M_ \u2217 \u223c _M_ h[2][\u2212][3] at dwarf masses and _M_ \u2217 \u223c _M_ h[1] _[/]_[3] at the high-mass end.

It is likely due to a combination of a number of processes: at high mass, AGN feedback can act to heat halo gas and limit future star formation (Silk & Rees 1998, Croton et al. 2006); at low mass, feedback from massive stars is believed to be important in driving winds that eject gas or prevent it from coming into a galaxy (Dekel & Silk 1986, Hopkins et al. 2012); at even lower masses, galaxies can be too small to hold onto their gas during the reionization period around _z_ \u223c 6 (Bullock et al. 2000). We discuss the constraints on this relation in more detail in Sections 5 and 6, but here we note that many different techniques are telling the same basic story. Below some threshold halo mass, galaxies will no longer be able to form at all. The smallest known galaxies, ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, have measured dynamical masses in their inner regions larger than a few times 10[7] M\u2299, which is most likely equivalent to halo virial masses of greater than 10[9] M\u2299",

This can be inferred directly from measurements of groups and clusters (Lin et al. 2004; Weinmann et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2008, 2009; Hansen et al. 2009) or from a full model for galaxy clustering and abundance (Yang et al. 2003, Cooray 2006). In general, this parameterization distinguishes between central galaxies, which are usually assumed to follow a log-normal distribution of stellar masses or luminosities at fixed halo mass, and satellite galaxies, which are usually assumed to follow a Schechter function (Schechter 1976) whose parameters scale with halo mass",

Both models specify the number of galaxies per halo, thus one can populate halos identified in an _N_ -body simulation using a Monte Carlo approach, and measure observables from the resulting mock galaxy catalog. Alternatively, both of these frameworks can be combined with an analytic halo model of dark matter clustering to make predictions for some statistics analytically (see, e.g., Tinker et al. 2005 and van den Bosch et al. 2013).

Although there is still significant uncertainty in the details, there has been dramatic progress in producing realistic galaxy populations in hydrodynamical simulations over the past decade, due to increasing resolution as well as improved physical models for star formation and feedback, based on insight from a wide range of observations.

As we discuss in Section 4, models with different assumptions regarding how galaxies are matched to halos can change the relative rank-ordering of halos and subhalos, thus shifting the relative populations of central and satellite galaxies",

Modern-day galaxy group catalogs are able to probe much lower halo mass scales. The groupfinding algorithm of Yang et al. (2005) uses a variation of the abundance matching ansatz to assign dark matter halo masses statistically to all galaxies within a given sample. After an initial guess about which galaxies belong to groups and which do not, abundance matching is performed on the total group stellar mass and the host dark matter halo mass function. Each galaxy is assigned a probability of being within a given dark matter halo, using these updated halo masses, and the process is iterated until convergence",

Lensing generally has lower signal-to-noise than two-point clustering, but the constraints offered by a lensing analysis are complementary to that of an analysis only using clustering. Lensing directly measures the mass of the dark matter halos around galaxies, whereas in a clustering analysis the masses are inferred indirectly from the relationship between halo mass and clustering, as well as the constraints on the abundance of halos in a given cosmological model.

Additional Observables** Although the abundance of galaxies and their two-point clustering are the methods that have been most commonly used to statistically constrain the galaxy\u2013halo connection, there is information on this relationship from nearly any measure of the spatial distribution of galaxies. Within the literature, these include satellite kinematics (van den Bosch et al. 2004, More et al. 2011), galaxy voids (Sheth & van de Weygaert 2004, Furlanetto & Piran 2006, Tinker et al. 2008a), counts-incells (Benson et al. 2000, Berrier et al. 2011), and three-point statistics (Mar\u00b4\u0131n et al. 2008, Guo et al. 2015)",

BEYOND THE SIMPLEST MODELS OF THE GALAXY\u2013HALO CONNECTION** The simplest versions of the empirical models we outlined in Section 2, which connect one primary galaxy property to one halo property, describe the basic relations very well. However, they have now been shown in the literature to be inadequate for describing both the spatial distribution of galaxies at the precision it can now be measured and the full richness of galaxy properties and correlations that are observable.

Future large HI surveys should allow a more comprehensive study of this question. An alternative galaxy property is galaxy size.

HOD models parameterize the mean number of galaxies per halo. For HOD models of luminosity or stellar mass threshold samples, the scatter is incorporated in the shape of the central galaxy occupation function. For central galaxies, because there can only be one or zero centrals, this translates to the probability of having a galaxy above the threshold as a function of halo mass.

It is not a requirement of abundance matching or SHMR models that they treat the galaxies within host halos and subhalos the same. Indeed, the _M_ 0,peak and _V_ 0,peak models in that figure explicitly separate the two.

Observational systematics.** It is worth noting that definitions and measurement uncertainties can matter both qualitatively and quantitatively. A particularly important systematic error is the fact that in large imaging surveys, the surveys have surface brightness limits and imperfect pipelines that can lead to mis-estimates of the total mass of a galaxy. For some time, most of the low-redshift estimates of the SHMR were based on stellar mass and clustering estimates of SDSS data. These studies may have underestimated the stellar mass/luminosity of brightest cluster galaxies by factors of several at the massive end (Bernardi et al. 2017, Huang et al. 2018, Kravtsov et al. 2018). There are actually several related issues that can impact this estimation",

Differences in the estimation of sky subtraction dominate, but modeling the outer profiles of galaxies, distinguishing between central galaxies and the intracluster light (Conroy et al. 2007), and the estimation of stellar masses themselves can also contribute. The high-mass end of the SHMR has important consequences for inferences about cooling rates and feedback in massive galaxies, and studies that were based on these earlier results should be reevaluated in this light. In particular, based on more recent estimates that indicate increased mass estimates of massive galaxies, group and cluster mass halos should be expected to host larger central galaxies than earlier estimates would have indicated, for example, scaling as _M_ \u2217 \u223c _M_ h[0] _[.]_[4][; this can be seen in the estimate of the SHMR in] **[ Figure 2]**[ from] Kravtsov et al.

Theoretical systematics.** Although gravity is a well-understood process, the results of cosmological _N_ -body simulations are still subject to systematic errors that can impact the predictions of models of the galaxy\u2013halo connection. These errors fall into two main categories: resolution and substructure disruption, and robustness of halo finding and tracking. Lack of spatial and temporal resolution can limit the ability of a simulation to resolve substructure within halos, even with proper mass resolution (see, e.g., Moore et al. 1998, Klypin et al. 1999, Ghigna et al. 2000)",

Lack of subhalos equates to lack of satellite galaxies, which can cause models to compare poorly with clustering measurements or, alternatively, can drive model selection to parameters that artificially increase the number of satellites. To account for this, some studies incorporate orphan subhalos that algorithmically follow the estimated path of disrupted substructure. In some SAMs, the fraction of galaxies represented by orphans can be 10\u201330% (Pujol et al. 2017). To control for this in abundance matching, studies like that by Reddick et al.

Many theoretical models require knowledge of the full history of a given halo or subhalo to properly assign its galaxy. Commonly used algorithms such as ROCKSTAR (Behroozi et al. 2013c) and SUBFIND (Springel et al. 2001) do not always yield the same results.

The first detection of two-halo conformity was presented by Kauffmann et al. (2013). Their approach to conformity was to identify central galaxies through an isolation criterion, then rank order the central galaxies by their specific star-formation rates (sSFRs) and calculate the median sSFR of neighbor galaxies for each quartile in the central sSFR. The measurements showed a substantial decrease in the sSFR of neighbor galaxies around the lowest star-forming central galaxies out to 4 Mpc. However, further studies by Tinker et al.

Thus, late-forming halos should have higher stellar masses than early-forming halos, an opposite effect from that seen in the theoretical models.

Why Do Galaxy Properties Depend on Environment?** The correlation between galaxy properties and galaxy environment is well established (Balogh et al. 2004, Kauffmann et al. 2004, Blanton et al. 2005, Blanton & Berlind 2007). Properties such as color, SFR, S\u00b4ersic index, and morphology are each correlated with local galaxy density on all measurable scales. The conclusion of these studies has been that environment mattered most on small scales, and once that environment was fixed, correlations on larger scales were eliminated. However, no ideal scale for environment to characterize the full dependence could be identified from the data (Blanton et al. 2006, Blanton & Berlind 2007)",

Kravtsov (2013) explored the question of how galaxy size is related to halo properties in a standard abundance matching model, matching stellar mass to halo mass. They showed that in this model one obtains an approximately linear relation between the galaxy half-mass radius and the halo radius, with tight scaling across six decades of mass: _R_ g \u223c 0 _._ 015 _R_ halo, with scatter of 0.2 dex and with fairly similar scaling for elliptical and spiral galaxies",

Higher-order perturbation theory generally breaks down at scales around 10\u201320 Mpc or at larger scales for redshift-space clustering (Carlson et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2014). Thus, extracting information out of megaparsec scales requires a model that is fully nonlinear. The galaxy\u2013halo connection provides such a model, provided the model is flexible enough to incorporate any systematic uncertainties, including the accuracy of predictions for scale-dependent halo clustering, galaxy assembly bias, and the impact of baryonic physics on the abundance and clustering of dark matter halos",

In the next decade, we expect that our understanding of the detailed connection between galaxies and halos over mass, redshift, and environment will provide major strides forward in galaxy formation, cosmological parameters, and the nature of dark energy and neutrino mass, and in understanding the nature of dark matter. At the same time, it is clear that for this promise to be realized, the precision of models for the galaxy\u2013halo connection will need to keep up with the pace of the data. In closing, we highlight some of the most interesting near-term future issues.",

Characterizing them will likely provide interesting insights into galaxy-formation physics; in addition, effectively modeling assembly bias will be important to mitigate systematic uncertainties in some cosmological constraints. 2. The mass dependence of the normalization and scatter in the galaxy\u2013halo connection is still poorly constrained at halo masses below \u223c10[12] M\u2299. This has important consequences for interpreting measurements of dwarf galaxies in the context of dark matter models. 3. Characterizing the halo occupation of galaxies identified with complex selection criteria, including, for example, colors, SFRs, sizes, morphologies, and line widths, will be increasingly important for cosmological studies. ~~4",

The relationship between galaxy color, galaxy size, and galaxy morphologies and halo~~ properties at fixed stellar mass is still uncertain; there is a need for models and observational tests of models that connect galaxy sizes and morphologies to dark matter halos across cosmic time. 5. Statistically mapping the relationship between halos and the gas surrounding and fueling galaxies is still in the early stages, and constraints on these relationships should provide new physical insight into galaxy formation. 6. Baryonic processes, especially various forms of feedback, may modify the abundance and clustering properties of dark matter halos, with important implications for inferences about the galaxy\u2013halo connection. 7. A primary challenge for future surveys is optimizing joint constraints on the galaxy\u2013 halo connection and cosmological parameters, which will require judicious choices in parameterizing the former to retain maximal constraining power",

These simulations are part of the Making Galaxies In a Cosmological Context (MAGICC) program in which the stellar feedback is tuned to match the stellar mass\u2013halo mass relationship. For comparison, each galaxy was also simulated using a \u2018lower feedback\u2019 (LF) model which has strength comparable to other implementations in the literature. The \u2018MAGICC feedback\u2019 (MF) model has a higher incidence of massive stars and an approximately two times higher energy input per supernova. Apart from the low-mass halo using LF, each galaxy exhibits a metal-enriched CGM that extends to approximately the virial radius",

Our models also predict a reservoir of cool H I clouds that show strong Ly _\u03b1_ absorption to several hundred kpc. Comparing these models to recent surveys with the _Hubble Space Telescope_ , we find that only the MF models have sufficient O VI and H I gas in the CGM to reproduce the observed distributions. In separate analyses, these same MF models also show better agreement with other galaxy observables (e.g. rotation curves, surface brightness profiles and H I gas distribution).

It is predicted that baryons fall into these haloes with the dark matter, comprising a mass fraction up to the cosmological ratio. Recent analyses indicate that stars comprise less than 25 per cent of the baryons that should have collapsed into haloes (Conroy & Wechsler 2009; Mandelbaum et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2010; Moster et al. 2010; More et al. 2011). This presents a \u2018missing baryon\u2019 problem reflected in the unknown whereabouts of the baryons, which did not cool to form stars. Substantial amount of gas is found in a diffuse and highly ionized medium which is referred to as halo gas or the circumgalactic medium (CGM)",

Smaller disc galaxies have X-ray bright outflows (Strickland et al. 2004), but halo emission remains undetected. The diffuse nature of the CGM makes positive detections of emission rare. The majority of empirical constraints, therefore, come from the absorption-line analysis of galactic haloes, along coincident sightlines to distant quasars and galaxies (e.g. Lanzetta, Wolfe & Turnshek 1995; Bowen, Blades & Pettini 1996; Chen & Tinker 2008; Rubin et al. 2010; Steidel et al. 2010)",

Previous theoretical work on the CGM for individual galaxies has largely focused on analytic or semi-analytic treatments of idealized gas and dark matter/temperature profiles (Mo & Miralda-Escude 1996; Telfer et al. 2002; Maller & Bullock 2004; Binney, Nipoti & Fraternali 2009).

Metal diffusion is included, and metal cooling is calculated based on the diffused metals (Shen, Wadsley & Stinson 2010). Two different star formation and feedback models are employed. The original MUGS formed stars when gas reached a density of 1.0 cm[\u2212][3] , used a Kroupa et al. (1993) initial mass function (IMF) and deposited 0.4 \u00d7 10[51] ergs per supernova explosion.

Radiation pressure from massive stars can have significant effects on the scales that are resolved in our simulations (Nath & Silk 2009; Murray, M\u00b4enard & Thompson 2011). Massive stars typically produce 10[50] ergs of energy per M\u2299, yet this couples only weakly to the interstellar medium (ISM; Freyer, Hensler & Yorke 2006).

Another valuable kinematic constraint is the common observation of co-aligned H I and O VI absorption relative to a common redshift (approximately half of observed O VI systems; Thom & Chen 2008b). Indeed, this appears to be at odds with the apparent separation of strong H I absorption (at smaller radii) with the extended O VI absorption of our modelled CGM. On the other hand, we do observe non-negligible H I absorption to large radii (Fig. 4) which may trace the O VI gas. A proper comparison of our model with these observables will require the generation and detailed analysis of line profiles, as well as the examination of the CGM for galaxies spanning a wide range of masses",

We further note that the H I surface densities at _\u03c1 <_ 50 kpc are sufficiently large that the CGM will yield significant absorption from lower ionization states of heavy metals (e.g. Mg II, Si II, Si III). A proper estimate of the column densities for these ions, however, will require a full treatment of radiative transfer (i.e. to account for self-shielding by optically thick H I gas). The fact that the resultant extended, metal-enriched CGM around our simulated galaxies matches the observations over a wide range of mass provides strong support for a vigorous baryon cycle in which outflows and subsequent cooling of halo gas play a key role in forming disc galaxies. ## **ACKNOWLEDGMENTS** We thank Kate Rubin for useful conversations.

We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the stellar-to-halo-mass relation to populate haloes and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed stellar mass functions at several redshifts are reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if observational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the average assembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the galaxies (in situ) and accretion of stars (ex situ). Our main results are the peak star formation efficiency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at _z_ = 0 to 9 per cent at _z_ =4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 10[11.8] to 10[12.5] M\u2299",

The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo mass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the peak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky Way about half of the central stellar mass is assembled after _z_ = 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex situ with significant accretion of satellites at _z <_ 2. We find that our method implies a cosmic star formation history and an evolution of specific star formation rates which are consistent with those inferred directly.

In this framework, galaxy formation is driven by the growth of the underlying large-scale structure and the formation of dark matter haloes: galaxies form by the cooling and condensation of gas at the centres of the potential wells of such dark matter haloes (White & Rees 1978; Fall & Efstathiou 1980)",

This results in a tight correla_\u22c6_ E-mail: moster@mpa-garching.mpg.de tion between the physical properties of galaxies, such as their stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR), and the mass of the haloes by which they are hosted. Galaxy formation studies have adopted several approaches to link galaxy properties to those of the dark matter haloes. The most direct is to model the physical mechanisms that drive the formation of galaxies from first principles. Here, an _N_ -body treatment of the dark matter evolution is combined with a treatment of the baryonic component based either on a hydrodynamical (Katz, Weinberg & Hernquist 1996; Springel & Hernquist 2003; Kere\u02c7s et al. 2005; Crain et al. 2009; Oppenheimer et al. 2010; Schaye et al. 2010) or on a semi-analytic method (Kauffmann et al. 1999; Springel et al. 2001, 2005; Hatton et al. 2003; Kang et al. 2005; Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2011)",

An alternative approach to link galaxies to haloes has emerged with the accumulation of data from large galaxy surveys (Cole et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2003; Drory et al. 2005; Fontana et al. 2006; Panter et al. 2007; P\u00b4erez-Gonz\u00b4alez et al. 2008; Li & White 2009; Santini et al. 2012). Instead of attempting to model the baryonic physics that drive galaxy formation, dark matter haloes are populated with galaxies using a simple empirical method with adjustable parameters. In the popular halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism, the distribution of galaxies (having certain intrinsic properties such as luminosity, colour or type) within main haloes of a given mass is constrained using galaxy abundance and clustering statistics (e.g. Peacock & Smith 2000; White 2001; Berlind & Weinberg 2002; Zehavi et al",

A variant of the classical HOD approach is the conditional luminosity function (CLF) formalism (van den Bosch, Yang & Mo 2003; Yang, Mo & van den Bosch 2003; Yang et al. 2012). Since reliable galaxy clustering measurements are unavailable at high redshift, the HOD and CLF approaches have typically been used at low redshift. In order to circumvent this problem, galaxies can be linked to the underlying substructure directly by assuming a monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo mass, and matching the cumulative abundance of galaxies to those of haloes and subhaloes (Vale & Ostriker 2004, 2006; Conroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov 2006; Shankar et al. 2006; Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler 2010; Guo et al. 2010; Moster et al. 2010)",

The only observational input to this \u2018abundance matching\u2019 method is thus the observed stellar mass function (SMF) or luminosity function. This approach then predicts clustering statistics remarkably well. In this framework, the stellar-tohalo-mass (SHM) relation can be obtained in two ways. The first (e.g. Conroy et al. 2006) is to create a mock galaxy catalogue from the observed SMF for the simulated volume, to order both galaxies and haloes by mass, and then to match them one by one. A fitting function can then be used to get the SHM relation. The second way (e.g. Moster et al. 2010) is first to assume a functional form for the SHM relation, and then to populate the haloes with galaxies and compute the model SMF. The parameters of the SHM function are then adjusted so that the observed SMF is reproduced",

The latter approach has the advantage that scatter in stellar mass at a given halo mass can easily be added. The underlying assumptions in this model are that satellite galaxies are living in subhaloes and were central galaxies before their own haloes were accreted and became subhaloes. The properties of the galaxy population today are thus a consequence of the formation of central galaxies in main haloes at different redshifts and the subsequent accretion and evolution of satellites. Since the subhalo is affected much more by tidal stripping than the galaxy at its centre, the stellar mass of satellites is more closely related to subhalo mass at the time of accretion rather than to current subhalo mass. Most abundance matching studies simply assign the infall mass to subhaloes. As pointed out by Yang et al",

However, applying the technique at different redshifts results in an evolving SHM relation (e.g. Conroy et al. 2006; Moster et al. 2010). This indicates that the classical abundance matching approach is not self-consistent. This problem can be solved if we assign the stellar mass of the satellites depending on the infall mass of their subhalo _and_ the infall redshift. The stellar mass of the central galaxies still depends on the main halo mass at the redshift of observation in the same way. This is equivalent to assuming that the stellar mass of a satellite does not change, once it has entered the main halo",

The stellar mass of a galaxy at redshift _z_ is then given by In this way we can derive the stellar mass of any galaxy just by employing the redshift-dependent SHM relation for central galaxies. This relation can then be constrained with a set of SMFs at different redshifts.

At high redshift, the low-mass slope is much steeper, so that more galaxies are scattered towards (and beyond) the mass of the peak efficiency.

This is a consequence of the shallow low-mass slope of the SMFs, so that the observational mass error does not change the SMFs much.

Very massive galaxies in haloes with _M_ vir = 10[14] M\u2299 show a very interesting behaviour: while they begin to form very early and have 25 per cent of their stellar mass in place already by redshift _z_ = 3.0, it takes them a long time to fully assemble. Half of their stellar mass is in place only by redshift _z_ = 1.6, while 75 per cent is assembled by _z_ = 0.3. The final _z_ = 0 stellar mass is then assembled very quickly. The reason why these massive galaxies grow very fast at early times, only grow slowly at intermediate redshifts and grow fast again at late times can be found in the two processes that contribute to the growth of galaxies. At high redshift, a massive galaxy grows effectively by star formation, while at low redshift, stellar accretion leads to a fast growth. At intermediate redshift, however, neither of these processes is effective, so that the galaxy grows only very slowly. In the following section we aim to constrain and separate these two processes",

In principle, both processes can contribute simultaneously to the growth of a central galaxy, but in practice one process will dominate over the other as a function of halo mass and redshift. In order to separate the contributions from star formation and accretion, we have first to determine the amount of accretion of subhaloes on to the central object in the halo",

The subhaloes that have e.g. one-tenth of the main halo mass host galaxies that are almost as massive as the central galaxy, so that the resulting accretion rates are high.

As the main haloes of massive centrals reach this mass earlier than those of low-mass centrals, this implies that the stellar mass assembly history of massive galaxies peaks earlier than that of low-mass galaxies. Although star formation ceases at low redshift for massive systems, the stellar mass of their central galaxies can grow considerably through accreted satellite galaxies.

Our model indicates that low-mass (massive) galaxies form late (early), although their dark matter haloes assemble early (late). Although the haloes of low-mass galaxies assemble early it takes a considerable amount of time for the gas to cool and fall to the centre and form stars. In massive systems, on the other hand, the central galaxies (and the galaxies that will become satellites in these systems) can start to grow very early and form the bulk of their stars at high redshift. However, their haloes assemble only late, and the satellites are accreted on to the central galaxies at low redshift. Therefore, the stellar populations of massive galaxies are old, although massive haloes assemble late",

The characteristic shape of the SHM relation is a consequence of several different physical processes that prevent the gas in the dark matter halo from cooling (or reheat cold gas) and forming stars. The contribution of each process varies for systems of different mass. In low-mass systems, feedback from supernova-driven winds can be very effective as winds can easily expel large amounts of gas from haloes with low escape velocities (e.g. Larson 1974; Dekel & Silk 1986; Oppenheimer & Dav\u00b4e 2008; Puchwein & Springel 2012).

However, with the current data it is very hard to find this transition mass, as the error estimates are even larger than the possible variations in the slope. In massive haloes the star formation efficiency may be lowered by feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN; Springel et al. 2005; Bower et al. 2006; Croton et al. 2006; Somerville et al. 2008; Hambrick et al. 2011; Teyssier et al. 2011; Martizzi et al. 2012; Puchwein & Springel 2012) which can heat the gas in the halo and prevent it from cooling.

In fact, there exists a variety of functional forms in the literature.

With this approach we populate haloes with galaxies over the entire cosmic period from _z_ \u223c 4 to the present, using the _N_ -body Millennium simulations and observed SMFs. Unlike the classical abundance matching technique our new method is self-consistent, taking into account that subhaloes are accreted at earlier times and with higher masses than when they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent parametrization of the SHM relation, and populate haloes and subhaloes with galaxies requiring that the observed SMFs at different redshifts be reproduced simultaneously",

When we include observational mass errors, this tension vanishes and massive galaxies also have a physically consistent stellar mass evolution. We find that the halo mass where galaxy formation is most efficient is log ( _M_ vir _/_ M\u2299) \u223c 11.8 at _z_ = 0 and increases with increasing redshift to log ( _M_ vir _/_ M\u2299) \u223c 12.5 at _z_ = 4. Thus at high redshift, the peak efficiency of converting baryons into stars occurs in more massive haloes. The normalization of the SHM ratio decreases with increasing redshift: while at _z_ = 0 the most efficient haloes have converted \u223c23 per cent of their baryons into stars, at _z_ = 4 the peak efficiency is less than \u223c10 per cent",

The sample covers a wide mass range: 9.4 \u00d7 10[9] _< M_ halo _/_ M\u2299 _<_ 7.8 \u00d7 10[11] , hosting galaxies with stellar masses in the range 5.0 \u00d7 10[5] _< M_ \u2217 _/_ M\u2299 _<_ 8.3 \u00d7 10[10] , i.e. from dwarf to L[\u2217] . The galaxies are simulated with blastwave supernova feedback and, for some of them, an additional source of energy from massive stars is included. Within this feedback scheme we vary several parameters, such as the initial mass function, the density threshold for star formation, and energy from supernovae and massive stars. The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope of the dark matter density profile, _\u03b1_ in _\u03c1_ \u221d _r[\u03b1]_ , on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo. This relation is independent of the particular choice of parameters within our stellar feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp versus core formation",

When _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo is low, \u22720.01 per cent, energy from stellar feedback is insufficient to significantly alter the inner dark matter density, and the galaxy retains a cuspy profile. At higher stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback drives the expansion of the dark matter and generates cored profiles. The flattest profiles form where _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo \u223c 0.5 per cent. Above this ratio, stars formed in the central regions deepen the gravitational potential enough to oppose the supernova-driven expansion process, resulting in cuspier profiles. Combining the dependence of _\u03b1_ on _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo with the empirical abundance matching relation between _M_ \u2217 and _M_ halo provides a prediction for how _\u03b1_ varies as a function of stellar mass. Further, using the Tully\u2013Fisher relation allows a prediction for the dependence of the dark matter inner slope on the observed rotation velocity of galaxies",

Problems at small scales, however, still affect the _\ufffd_ CDM model, one of which is the so-called \u2018cusp-core\u2019 problem. A prediction of pure DM collisionless simulations is that DM density increases as _\u03c1_ \u221d _r_[\u2212][1] towards the halo centre (Navarro, Frenk & WhiteNavarro et al. 1996b; Springel et al.",

Simulated DM haloes modelled with an Einasto (Einasto 1965) profile have an inner slope of \u22120.7 (Graham et al. 2006): this value is closer to what observed in real galaxies (Swaters et al. 2003), yet not sufficient to solve the discrepancy (de Blok, Bosma & McGaugh 2003).

For example, as gas cools to the central region of galaxy haloes, it adiabatically contracts DM to the centre (e.g. Blumenthal et al. 1986; Gnedin et al. 2004). Such adiabatic contraction exacerbates the mismatch between the profiles of DM haloes and the observed density profiles inferred from rotation curves. Further, theoretical models with halo contraction are unable to self-consistently reconcile the observed galaxy scaling relations, such as the rotation velocity\u2013luminosity and size\u2013luminosity relations. Uncontracted or expanded haloes are required (Dutton et al. 2007, 2011). Two main mechanisms have been shown to cause expansion: supernova (SN) feedback (Navarro, Eke & FrenkNavarro et al",

SN feedback drives sufficient gas outflows to flatten the central DM density profile in simulated dwarf galaxies (Governato et al. 2010; Teyssier et al. 2013) into a \u2018core\u2019. Dynamical friction smoothes DM density profiles during mergers. The analytical model of Pontzen & Governato (2012) predicts that repeated outflows, rather than a single, impulsive mass-loss (as in Navarro, Eke & FrenkNavarro et al. 1996a), transfer energy to the DM. The rapid oscillations of the central gravitational potential perturb the DM orbits, creating a core. Mashchenko et al.

This rescaling allows us to compare galaxies with exactly the same merger histories at three different masses. Differences in the underlying power spectrum that result from this rescaling are minor (Macci`o et al. 2008; Springel et al. 2008; Kannan et al. 2012).

Some example density profiles are shown in Fig. 1. It shows how the DM density profiles of the hydrodynamic simulations can vary depending on physics (MUGS in black compared to MaGICC fiducial simulations, which use early stellar feedback, in red), galaxy mass (solid line at high mass and dashed line at medium mass), and how the hydrodynamic simulations compare with the DM-only run (solid grey line)",

This flattening is due to the increasing energy available from SN explosions, as derived in Pe\u02dcnarrubia et al. (2012). Indeed, all the galaxies in our sample whose inner slope is shallower than the corresponding DM run have had an energy injection from SNe equal to or higher than the conservative values found in Pe\u02dcnarrubia et al.

We note, however, that in our simulations the core-creation process does not only depend on the total amount of energy available: in the g15784 MUGS dwarf galaxy (black triangle), for example, the energy from SNe is higher than in the g15784 dwarfs of the same mass that had an expansion, yet this galaxy is strongly contracted",

Equation (4) of Dutton et al. (2010) parametrizes _V_ rot at 2.2 _I_ -band exponential scalelengths as a function of _M_ \u2217. Using this _M_ \u2217\u2013 _V_ rot relation we predict _\u03b1_ as a function of _V_ rot, the rotation velocity of galaxies. Fig. 6 shows, for the different radial ranges where we measure the inner density profile, _\u03b1_ as a function of observed rotation velocity for galaxies with _M_ halo \u2264 10[12] M\u2299. The dashed lines indicate where the TF relationship was linearly extrapolated for _M_ \u2217 _<_ 10[9] M\u2299. Fig. 6 shows that the galaxies with the flattest inner density profiles are found at _V_ rot \u223c 50 km s[\u2212][1] . _\u03b1_ decreases in more massive galaxies where the inner density profiles become more cuspy until they reach the NFW profile",

We note that the position at which the inner slope is measured has an effect on the _\u03b1_ values, which alters the best-fitting parameters reported in Table 2, and consequently determines how _\u03b1_ varies with rotation velocity. Thus, Fig. 6 has to be interpreted according to the radial range chosen, though the general trends are not changed and the peak of _\u03b1_ remains at _V_ rot \u223c 50 km s[\u2212][1] , independent of where the slope is measured. The major difference between _\u03b1_ measured at 0.01 _< r/R_ vir _<_ 0.02 and the other radial ranges is that the inner slope is steeper for _V_ rot _>_ 100 km s[\u2212][1] in the former case. A steeper slope is expected because 0.01 _< r/R_ vir _<_ 0.02 is farther from the galaxy centre than the other two measurements. However, none of the measured _\u03b1_ values falls below the NFW expectation as _V_ rot approaches 250 km s[\u2212][1] . Thus, DM haloes are never contracted in our model, even in the most massive disc galaxies",

Thus, DM haloes are never contracted in our model, even in the most massive disc galaxies. ## **4 CONCLUSIONS** Using 31 simulated galaxies from the MaGICC project, we showed that DM density profiles are modified by baryonic processes in the centre of galactic haloes. The inner profile slope depends solely on the mass of stars formed per halo mass and is independent of the particular choice of feedback parameters within our blastwave and early stellar feedback scheme. Similar to previous work, the **Figure 6.** Expected relation between the galaxies\u2019 rotation velocity and inner slope of their DM haloes. The three lines correspond to different radial ranges used for measuring _\u03b1_ .

At values of _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo \u2272 0.01 per cent, the energy from stellar feedback is not sufficient to modify the DM distribution, and these galaxies retain a cuspy profile. At higher stellar-to-halo mass ratios, feedback drives the expansion of the DM haloes, resulting in cored profiles. The shallowest profiles form in galaxies with _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo \u223c 0.5 per cent. According to the abundance matching relation (Moster et al. 2013), these galaxies have _M_ halo \u2248 10[10.8] M\u2299 and _M_ \u2217 \u2248 10[8.5] M\u2299.

The abundance matching peak of star formation efficiency, _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo = 3.8 per cent, occurs at _M_ halo = 10[11.76] M\u2299, which is close to the lowest current estimate of the Milky Way mass. Our model predicts that such a halo will be uncontracted and have an NFW-like inner slope of _\u03b1_ = \u22121.20 when the slope is measured between \u223c2 and \u223c4 kpc. We combine our parametrization of _\u03b1_ as a function of _M_ \u2217 _/M_ halo with the empirical abundance matching relation to assign a median relationship between _\u03b1_ and _M_ \u2217. The inner slope of the DM density profile increases with stellar mass to a maximum (most cored profile) at _M_ \u2217 \u2248 10[8.5] M\u2299, before decreasing towards cuspier profiles at higher stellar masses. Below _M_ \u2217 \u2248 10[8.5] M\u2299 the DM inner slope increases with stellar mass as _\u03b1_ \u221d 0.34 log10 _M_ \u2217 _/_ M\u2299, similar to the relation found in Governato et al. (2012).

The TF relation allows us to predict the dependence of the DM inner slope on the observed rotation velocity of galaxies. Using our results and the stellar mass TF relation from Dutton et al. (2010), we find that the flattest inner profiles are expected for galaxies with _V_ rot \u223c 50 km s[\u2212][1] . _\u03b1_ decreases for more massive galaxies, leading to cuspier profiles and eventually reaching the NFW prediction at the Milky Way mass. We note that, in agreement with our findings, the most clear observational measurements of flattened \u2018core\u2019 profiles of disc galaxies (de Blok et al. 2008; Kuzio de Naray et al. 2008, 2009; Oh et al. 2011) are found in low surface brightness galaxies with _V_ rot _<_ 100 km s[\u2212][1]",

More massive disc galaxies, being baryon dominated, suffer from larger uncertainties in the disc\u2013halo decomposition of their rotation curves, making it difficult to distinguish if their DM profile is cuspy or cored. Some studies conclude that such galaxies, those with _V_ rot _>_ 150 km s[\u2212][1] , can be described with cored profiles (Borriello & Salucci 2001; Donato, Gentile & Salucci 2004; McGaugh et al. 2007), while others find that the NFW model provides equally good fits for these high-luminosity galaxies (de Blok et al. 2008; Kuzio de Naray et al. 2008). More recently, Martinsson et al. (2013) presented rotation-curve mass decompositions of several massive spiral galaxies, and found no significant difference between the quality of a pseudo-isothermal sphere or an NFW model in fitting the DM rotation curves of individual galaxies, given the uncertainties in the contribution of baryons",

An aspect not taken into account in our simulations of galaxy formation is the influence of active galactic nucleus feedback on the density profile of DM haloes. We acknowledge that this form of feedback starts to be relevant at the high-halo-mass end, where we observe increasingly cuspy galaxies: the study of the core\u2013cusp problem would thus benefit from a future implementation of this type of feedback. Our novel prediction for cusp versus core formation can be tested and, at least at the low-halo-mass end, well constrained using observational data sets. This study can be applied to theoretical modelling of galaxy mass profiles, as well as to modelling of populations of disc galaxies within CDM haloes. We find this encouraging and hope that our study motivates more systematic analysis of the dependance of _\u03b1_ on galaxy mass in real disc galaxies",

We show that this relation holds approximately at all redshifts (with an intrinsic scatter of \u223c0.18 in _\u03b1_ measured between 1 and 2 per cent of the virial radius). This implies that in practically all haloes the shape of their inner density profile changes quite substantially over cosmic time, as they grow in stellar and total mass",

Thus, depending on their final _M_ star _/M_ halo ratio, haloes can either form and keep a substantial density core ( _R_ core \u223c 1 kpc), or form and then destroy the core and recontract the halo, going back to a cuspy profile, which is even steeper than cold-dark-matter predictions for massive galaxies (10[12] M\u2299). We show that results from the NIHAO suite are in good agreement with recent observational measurements of _\u03b1_ in dwarf galaxies. Overall our results suggest that the notion of a universal density profile for dark matter haloes is no longer valid in the presence of galaxy formation. **Key words:** hydrodynamics \u2013 galaxies: evolution \u2013 dark matter. ## **1 INTRODUCTION** The cold-dark-matter (CDM) theory is very successful at describing the Universe\u2019s topology and evolution on large scales (e.g. Springel et al. 2005)",

In the central kiloparsecs the potential changes on subdynamical time-scales, as repeated, energetic feedback generate large underdense bubbles of expanding gas. The fluctuations in the central potential irreversibly (e.g. non-adiabatically) transfer energy into collisionless particles, thus generating a DM core (see also Ogiya & Mori 2014, for a detailed analysis of the effect of resonances between DM particles and the density wave excited by the oscillating potential)",

They clearly showed that the halo response to star formation is non-monotonic and that haloes with very low and very high star formation efficiency (or with very low and high _M_ star _/M_ halo) tend to preserve the initial cuspy profile, while haloes with _M_ star _/M_ halo \u2248 0.3 per cent have a flat central density profile",

Gas can form stars when it satisfies a temperature and a density threshold: _T <_ 15 000 K and _n_ th _>_ 10.3 cm[\u2212][3] . Stars can feed energy back into the interstellar medium (ISM) via blast-wave supernova (SN) feedback (Stinson et al. 2006; see Agertz et al. 2013, for a discussion of the implementation of different energy and momentum stellar feedback in galaxy formation simulations) and via ionizing radiation from massive stars before they turn into SN.

The fraction of stellar mass that results in SN and winds is determined using the Chabrier (2003) stellar initial mass function. There are two small changes from the MaGICC simulations. The change in number of neighbours and the new combination of softening length and particle mass means the threshold for star formation increased from 9.3 to 10.3 cm[\u2212][3] . The increased hydrodynamic mixing necessitated a small increase of pre-SN feedback efficiency, _\u03f5_ ESF, from 0.1 to 0.13.

This similarity is even more striking when we take into account that the two simulation sets (NIHAO and FIRE) differ in resolution, numerical technique and stellar feedback implementation.

For the middle mass galaxy (which retains a cored profile all the way to _z_ = 0), the potential in the central region is dominated by DM and gas, while stars are subdominant. The amount of gas is rapidly varying with time and this causes quick potential variations and a rapid movement of the centre of mass of the gas compared to that of the DM; both these effects contribute in creating and maintaining a density core. The situation is quite different for the most massive galaxy: after _T_ = 8 Gyr the potential in central region is dominated by stars with the gas (and DM) being highly subdominant. At this point, the deeper potential well caused by the stars is anchoring the global potential and making any possible gas outflow a negligible effect",

This higher mass caused the gravitational potential to deepen and reduces the ability of baryonic feedback to counteract the DM contraction. It is worth noticing that the change in the mass distribution is mainly local (i.e. limited to the regions dominated by baryons) and not global, something that should be taken into account when computing analytic estimates of the total energy input from SN needed to alter the DM distribution. This is a still quite debated topic in the literature and our simulations can be used to determine the validity of different analytic approaches (e.g. Pe\u02dcnarrubia et al. 2012; Maxwell, Wadsley & Couchman 2015)",

In comparison with a similar study performed earlier with the MaGICC sample (DC14) we have a larger and more coherent set of simulations, which have been performed with the latest compilation of cosmological parameters from the Planck Collaboration XVI (2014). Moreover we use a substantially improved version of the GASOLINE code, which thanks to a new formulation of the SPH force computation (Keller et al. 2014), aims to solve the known shortcomings of the classical SPH implementation (Agertz et al",

Overall we confirm previous findings from DC14, namely that the effect of baryons on the slope ( _\u03b1_ ) of the central distribution of DM strongly depends on the ratio between the stellar mass and total mass of the halo. At the present time, haloes with an intermediate ratio of stellar-to-halo mass (10[\u2212][3] _< M_ star _/M_ halo _<_ 10[\u2212][2] ) tend to expand their profiles with respect to pure collisional simulations, haloes with lower values of _M_ star _/M_ halo tend to retain the original DM cuspy profile, while haloes with large ( _M_ star _/M_ halo _>_ 10[\u2212][2] ) ratio exhibit contracted profiles. There is a smooth transition among these different behaviours and we have parametrized it with a new, simple but accurate fitting formula",

The slopes predicted by the NIHAO simulation suite are in excellent agreement with high-resolution observations of dwarf galaxies from the THINGS and LITTLE THINGS surveys (Oh et al. 2015). When the analysis is, for the first time, extended to higher redshifts, we find that haloes tend to cluster around the redshift zero _\u03b1_ versus _M_ star _/M_ halo relation, even though the scatter around the mean increases with redshift. Our findings imply that even haloes that have very cuspy profiles today (as for example for Milky Way mass haloes), likely had a cored DM distribution in the past. We carefully looked at three specific haloes with masses around 10[10] , 10[11] and 10[12] M\u2299. The lightest shows a central slope of about \u22120.9 at _z_ = 0, which is consistent with a cuspy profile, but is also very much shallower than what a pure _N_ -body simulation predicts at the same mass and radii ( _\u03b1_ \u223c\u22121.6), pointing to a clear halo expansion even at these low-mass scales",

The other two haloes present a quite dynamic evolution in their central regions as a function of time, showing that not only cores are created and destroyed during the galaxy evolution but that this phenomenon happens on relatively (cosmologically) short timescales of the order of a Gyr. Overall our results show that one of the most firm predictions of the CDM theory, namely the existence of a \u2018universal profile\u2019, is no longer valid when galaxy formation is taken into account. The central part of any DM halo has had a much more tumultuous life than what dissipationless simulations predict. ## **ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS** It is a pleasure to thank Se-Heon Oh, for sending us his data in electronic form",

Apart from burstiness, Muni et al. (2024) highlighted the importance of the duration of the SFH on the process of core formation. Specifically, they found the ratio of stellar mass that formed after and before the re-ionisation epoch shows better correlation with the inner dark matter density of galaxies than the stellarto-halo mass ratio in the EDGE simulations (Agertz et al. 2019; Rey et al. 2025).

In this paper, we address this gap by homogeneously analysing two suites of simulated galaxies to quantify the burstiness of their SFHs and measure the corresponding slopes of their dark matter density profiles. We show that galaxies with similar stellar mass but differing degrees of burstiness can present remarkably different inner dark matter structures, with more bursty galaxies tending to produce cored profiles more often.

Star formation is allowed in dense gas that exceeds a density threshold number, set at _n_ th = 10.3 cm[\u2212][3] , using an initial mass function from Chabrier (2003). Feedback includes early energy injection from massive stars and the contribution of supernovae, where the latter is modelled using a blast-wave approach (Stinson et al. 2006). Gas evolution includes metal-line cooling, photoionisation, and ultraviolet heating, based on the prescriptions detailed by Shen et al. (2010). Specifically, the ultraviolet background is implemented via the Haardt & Madau (2012) model, which leads to the complete ionisation of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium by z \u223c 6.7.

Conclusions** In this work, we revisited the dependence of the inner slope of dark matter density profiles on the stellar-to-halo mass ratio using homogeneously analysed samples from the NIHAO and FIRE-2 simulations. Our results bring the two suites into closer agreement, showing that careful methodological consistency is essential when comparing simulations and interpreting apparent differences across studies. Whereas earlier comparisons between the analyses of Tollet et al. (2016) and Lazar et al. (2020) suggested that NIHAO galaxies were intrinsically more prone to developing cored dark matter profiles than those in FIRE-2, our homogeneous reanalysis shows that both simulation suites are capable of producing galaxies with similarly cored inner density structures. However, the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at which core formation is most efficient is slightly lower for NIHAO galaxies than for the FIRE-2 suite.",

By fitting the dependence of burstiness and SFH duration on stellar mass, we identified residuals that highlight galaxies which are more or less bursty, or have longer or shorter SFHs, than the average for their mass. These deviations act as secondary predictors of dark matter core formation, beyond the primary role of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio. Specifically, we find that galaxies which are burstier than average develop shallower inner dark matter slopes. Similarly, those with more extended SFHs are more efficient at producing cores. These SFH features explain the existing scatter in the relation between the inner slope and the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in both simulation suites. We also derived a new fitting formula for the inner slope that includes the contribution of the SFH duration via the _M_ \u22c6,post/ _M_ \u22c6,pre ratio (Eq. 6)",

The addition of a simple term and the joint fitting to data from each simulation revealed higher accuracy than using only the stellar-to-halo mass ratio as a fitting variable, lowering the mean squared error from 0.073 to 0.055 for FIRE-2 galaxies and from 0.063 to 0.048 for NIHAO simulations. Our analysis suggests that burstiness and SFH duration capture important aspects of the baryonic processes that shape dark matter profiles. However additional factors, such as the relative strength and timing of starbursts or their spatial distribution within galaxies, are likely to play a significant role. Exploring these features will be the focus of future work. The predicted relationship between core formation and SFH at fixed stellar mass has significant observational implications. Advances in resolved stellar population studies now enable accurate SFH measurements for low mass galaxies well beyond the virial radius of the Milky Way (e.g. Weisz et al. 2023; Cohen et al. 2025)",

Specifically, systems with stellar age distributions biased towards early times are expected to retain cuspier profiles than similar mass galaxies with extended, late time star formation. Observing large cores in objects dominated by early star formation would contradict this prediction, suggesting that feedback mechanisms alone are insufficient and pointing toward alternative scenarios such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM). _Acknowledgements._ JSA thanks the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MINECO) for support through a grant P/301404 from the Severo Ochoa project CEX2019-000920-S and the Fostering Grads organisation for sponsoring the ECUSA program, which made this international collaboration possible",

Nonetheless, several studies (e.g. Di Cintio et al. 2014b; Tollet et al. 2016) use a fixed overdensity of \u2206= 200c to investigate the relation between the inner slope of the dark matter density profile and the stellar-to-halo mass ratio. To facilitate a direct comparison to these works, we repeat our analysis using \u2206= 200c. For this purpose, we construct new density profiles analogous to those presented in Fig. 2 of Tollet et al. (2016), employing 56 logarithmically spaced bins spanning the range 0.01\u20131 _R_ 200c. We again apply Eq. 2 to fit the inner slope of the dark matter density profile, measured between 1\u20132% _R_ 200c, as a function of the stellar-to-halo mass ratio _M_ \u22c6/ _M_ 200c (see fitted parameters in Table A.1).

The scatter in the relation also increases, reaching 0.27 for NIHAO and 0.29 for FIRE-2. In addition, the stellar-to-halo mass ratio at which the profiles are maximally shallow shifts to higher values: 0.005 for NIHAO and 0.009 for FIRE-2. We note that the NIHAO peak value has increased slightly relative to our previous analysis, even though it rounds to the same value at one significant digit. **Table A.1.** Fitted parameters for each set of simulations using Eq. 2 and the overdensity \u2206= 200c",

They reported a tight, decreasing linear relation between the inner dark matter density and the ratio _M_ \u22c6,post/ _M_ \u22c6,pre. We replicate this analysis using FIRE-2 galaxies to calculate their density within a spherical shell ranging from 125 to 175 pc, with results shown in Fig. B.1. NIHAO galaxies are excluded due to insufficient spatial resolution. For some FIRE-2 galaxies, the 150 pc region lies within the _r_ 200[3] resolution limit; however, we check that extrapolating the resolved density profile confirms that the inner densities do not significantly deviate from expected values. Additionally, we plot the density at the innermost resolved bin, providing a lower limit for the density at 150 pc. Within the range of _M_ \u22c6,post/ _M_ \u22c6,pre values probed by EDGE simulations, we also recover a decreasing linear relation between inner density and _M_ \u22c6,post/ _M_ \u22c6,pre",

At higher _M_ \u22c6,post/ _M_ \u22c6,pre ratios, however, FIRE-2 galaxies show increased inner densities. We attribute this trend change to the broader stellar mass range in our sample. The relation for FIRE-2 galaxies is fitted using Eq. B.1 with _x_ = _M_ \u22c6,post/ _M_ \u22c6,pre. The resulting fitted parameters are: _x_ 0 = 2.14\u00d710[3] , _n_ = \u22126.22\u00d710[\u2212][2] , \u03b2 = 8.12\u00d710[\u2212][2] and \u03b3 = 1.98. The resulting fitted relation is qualitatively similar to the classical relation between the dark matter density inner slope and the stellar-to-halo mass ratio (see e.g. Fig. 1 and Eq. 1). Muni et al. (2024) also report a tight correlation between the _M_ \u22c6,post / _M_ \u22c6,pre and the inner slope of the dark matter density profile.

Following their methodology, we fixed the core radius parameter (rc) of the coreNFW profile to 1.8 times the three dimensional V-band half-light radius of the galaxy to break the degeneracy with the n parameter when fitting the dark matter density profile. Additionally, we fix the halo mass to the value derived from the simulation and constrain n to lie between 0 and 1. We note that the fixed core radius does not provide satisfactory fits for some galaxies in our sample, which span a broader range of stellar and halo properties than the EDGE simulations. Nevertheless, we confirm via visual inspection that the inner slope of the fitted profile generally matches the data. To quantify the fit quality, we compute the median relative deviation of the model from the data, finding that values above \u223c 0.15 typically indicate unreliable fits near the core radius",

Overall, we find that, due to these fitting limitations, the _n_ parameter is less reliable as a tracer of galactic coreness than the directly measured inner slope of the density profile. We notice FIRE-2 galaxies exhibit lower n values (cuspier) than EDGE galaxies for the same _M_ \u22c6,post / _M_ \u22c6,pre, indicating they require more extended SFHs for developing equally shallow density profiles. On top of that, the relation between n and the postand pre-reionisation stellar mass ratio is much more disperse for FIRE-2 galaxies, which do not follow a clear trend. > 3 The radius that encloses 200 dark matter particles. > Article number, page 9 of 9",
