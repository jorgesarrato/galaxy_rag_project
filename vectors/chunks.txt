These simulations are part of the Making Galaxies In a Cosmo- logical Context (MaGICC) program in which the stellar feedback is tu ned to match the stellar mass–halo mass relationship. For comparison, each galax y was also simu- lated using a “lower feedback” (LF) model which has strength comp arable to other implementations in the literature. The “MaGICC feedback” (MF) mod el has a higher incidence of massive stars and an ≈2×higher energy input per supernova. As

A signiﬁcant fraction of this gas h as been heated in supernova explosions in the disk and subsequently ejected into th e CGM where it is predicted to give rise to substantial OVI absorption. The simulatio ns do not yet ad- dress the question of what happens to the OVI when the galaxies st op forming stars. Our models a
hen the galaxies st op forming stars. Our models also predict a reservoir of cool HI clouds that show stro ng Lyαabsorption to several hundred kpc. Comparing these models to recent surve ys with the Hubble Space Telescope , we ﬁnd that only the MF models have suﬃcient OVI and HI gas in the CGM to reproduce the observed distributions. In separate an alyses, these same MF models also show better agreement with other galaxy observable s (e.g. rotation curves, surface brightness proﬁles, and HI gas 
on curves, surface brightness proﬁles, and HI gas distribution). We infer that the CGM is the dominant reservoir of baryons for galaxy halos. 1 INTRODUCTION In the paradigm of cold dark matter (CDM) cosmol- ogy, gravitational collapse leads to the formation of viri- alized and bound dark matter halos. It is predicted that baryons fall into these halos with the dark mat- ter, comprising a mass fraction up to the cosmological ratio. Recent analyses indicates that stars comprise less than 25% of th
 indicates that stars comprise less than 25% of the baryons that should have collapsed into halos (Conroy & Wechsler 2009; Mandelbaum et al. 2009; Moster et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2010; More et al. 2011). This presents a “missing baryon” problem reﬂected in the un- known whereabouts of the baryons, which did not cool to form stars. Substantial amounts of gas are found in a diﬀuse and highly ionized medium which is referred to as halo gas or the circumgalactic medium (CGM).The CGM is known to manif
cumgalactic medium (CGM).The CGM is known to manifest in at least two phases: (i) a warm/hot, collisionally ionized gas with temperature near the virial temperature ( T >∼106K); and (ii) a cooler phase (perhaps predominantly photoionized) with temper- atureT∼<104K. The latter phase has been detected in 21cm emission in our Galaxy in the population known as the high velocity clouds (e.g. Wakker & van Woerden 1997) lying at distances of tens of kpc (Thom et al. 2006). The hotter phase may be obser
 (Thom et al. 2006). The hotter phase may be observed via bremsstrahlung emission with X-ray telescopes, in the intracluster medium of mas- sive galaxy clusters (e.g. Allen et al. 2001), but so far ex- tended diﬀuse emission has only been detected around one disc galaxy, the massive NGC1961 (Anderson & Bregman 2011). Smaller disc galaxies have X-ray bright outﬂows c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS 2Stinson et al. (Strickland et al. 2004), but halo emission remains unde- tected. The diﬀuse nature of the CGM
remains unde- tected. The diﬀuse nature of the CGM makes positive de- tections of emission rare. The majority of empirical con- straints, therefore, come from absorption-line analysis o f galactic halos, along coincident sightlines to distant qua sars and galaxies (e.g. Bowen et al. 1996; Lanzetta et al. 1995; Chen & Tinker 2008; Rubin et al. 2010; Steidel et al. 2010). These observations reveal a cool and frequently metal- enriched phase traced by HI Lyman series absorption (e.g. Chen & Lanzett
by HI Lyman series absorption (e.g. Chen & Lanzetta 2003) and low-ionization metal-line tran- sitions (e.g. Chen & Tinker 2008; Barton & Cooke 2009; Rubin et al. 2012).Importantly,galaxies ofessentially al l lu- minosity and spectral type exhibit signiﬁcant HI absorptio n out to impact parameters R≈300kpc (Wakker & Savage 2009; Prochaska et al. 2011), implying a massive ( M∼ 1010M⊙) extended CGM. A particularly useful tracer of the hot phase in quasar absorption line analysis is the OVI doublet,
uasar absorption line analysis is the OVI doublet, which oc- curs in highly ionized and enriched regions of the Uni- verse. If collisionally ionized, the gas has temperature T∼ 105−106K. OVI is observed along the majority of sight- lines through our Galactic halo and is believed to trace coronal material on scales of 10–100kpc (Sembach et al. 2003). This gas is also associated with the CGM of local L >0.1L⋆galaxies (Stocke et al. 2006; Wakker & Savage 2009). Prochaska et al. (2011) have further

(2011) have further demonstrated thattheextendedCGM ( R∼300kpc)of L >∼0.1L⋆galax- ies has a high covering fraction to OVI and can account for all of the OVI detected in the present-day universe. Most recently, Tumlinson et al. (2011) report a nearly 100% in- cidence of strong OVI absorption for the halos of L∼L⋆ star-forming galaxies, with an ionized metal mass that like ly exceeds that of the galaxies’ interstellar media, demonstr at- ing that the CGM is a major re

The observations reveal a multi-phase, highly ion- ized and metal-enriched CGM around present-day galax- ies (also see Thom & Chen 2008b; Savage et al. 011a,b; Wakker et al. 2012). The high degree of enrichment de- mands that a large mass of gas (and metals) is transported from galaxies and/or their progenitors to the CGM. Thus, these observations provide robust constraints on the pro- cesses of gas accret
obust constraints on the pro- cesses of gas accretion and feedback which may be compared directly against models of galaxy formation. Previous theoretical work on the CGM for individual galaxies has largely focused on analytic or semi-analytic treatments of idealized gas and dark matter/temperature proﬁles (Mo & Miralda-Escude 1996; Telfer et al. 2002; Maller & Bullock 2004; Binney et al. 2009). Although these works provide crucial insight into the nature of the CGM, they lack proper cosmologica
he nature of the CGM, they lack proper cosmological context (e.g. mergers) and have generally not included the role of feedback from star- formation in the galaxy and its satellites. The latter is now considered critical to match a wide-range of galaxy observ- ables including the luminosity function, the stellar mass– halo mass relationship, and the baryonic Tully–Fisher rela - tionship(Guo et al. 2011).Galactic-scale windslikelyres ult- ing from stellar feedback are a nearly generic feature of 
 stellar feedback are a nearly generic feature of sta r forming galaxies (Shapley et al. 2003; Weiner et al. 2009; Rubin et al. 2010) and may signiﬁcantly inﬂuence proper- ties of the CGM.A number of groups have now used cosmological simu- lations to examine the nature and enrichment of the IGM atz∼0 and oﬀer comparisons to quasar absorption line observations (e.g. Cen & Ostriker 2006; Dav´ e et al. 2010; Oppenheimer et al. 2012; Smith et al. 2011; Cen 2012). These studies have not explicitly ex
1; Cen 2012). These studies have not explicitly examined the physical na- ture of the CGM for individual galaxies and likely have in- suﬃcient resolution to perform such analysis. A few authors have examined the distribution of gas within individual galactic halos, but have not yet treated the distribution of metals or the impact of feedback (Kereˇ s & Hernquist 2009; Stewart et al. 2011). At z∼3, Kawata & Rauch (2007) have analyzed numerical simulations of outﬂows in L⋆pro- genitors, and found 
ulations of outﬂows in L⋆pro- genitors, and found that OVI better reﬂects the strength of galactic winds than HI. Most recently, Fumagalli et al. (2012) and Shen et al. (2011) have examined the metal en- richment of the CGM with the latter demonstrating that metals can be ejected to large distances at early times from L⋆progenitor galaxies while their gravitational potential r e- mains low. We have recently begun the MaGICC project to use suﬃcient stellar feedback to simulate galaxies that match
t stellar feedback to simulate galaxies that match the stellar mass–halo mass relationship. Early results of the project have shown that the ejection of low angu- lar momentum gas via outﬂows (Brook et al. 2011) redis- tributes angular momentum via large scale galactic foun- tains(Brook et al. 2012)andthusplayacrucial role inform- ing disc galaxies, particularly those without classical bu lges. Inthis way,weform galaxies thatmatchscaling relations be - tween rotation velocity, size, luminosity, 
s be - tween rotation velocity, size, luminosity, colour, stella r mass, halo mass, HI mass, baryonic mass and metallicity (Brook et al. 2012, submitted). Macci` o et al. (2012) also showed that these galaxies have cored dark matter density proﬁles. Here , we test the baryon cycle of these simulations with the con- straints provided by observations of the CGM, and in par- ticular the column densities of HI and OVI as observed at z= 0. 2 SIMULATIONS We resimulate a suite of simulations drawn from
NS We resimulate a suite of simulations drawn from the Mc- Master Unbiased Galaxy Simulations (MUGS, Stinson et al. 2010). The simulations are listed in Table 1. The highest mass galaxy, HM, is g5664 from MUGS and is about half the Milky Way’s halo mass. The low mass galaxies, LM MF and LMLF, are rescaled versions of MUGS initial conditions, each a factor of eight lower mass than the MUGS simula- tions, allowing us to explore mass dependence. LM MF was also used in Brook et al. (2012). The simul
MF was also used in Brook et al. (2012). The simulations were evolved using the smoothed par- ticle hydrodynamics (SPH) code gasoline (Wadsley et al. 2004). Supernova energy is implemented using the blast- wave formalism (Stinson et al. 2006). Metals are ejected from type II supernovae (SNII), type Ia supernovae (SNIa), and the stellar winds of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. Ejected mass and metals are distributed to the nearest neighbour gas particles using the smoothing ker- nel (Stinson

We refer to this as the “lower feed- back model” (LF) in this study, but note that this feed- back strength is comparable to or even stronger than most implementations that are currently run in the liter- ature (Scannapieco et al. 2012). In our “MaGICC feedback model” (MF), four changes have been made to our imple- mentation of star formation and feedback: •we use the more common Chabrier (2003) IMF which creates more massive stars for a given stellar 
ch creates more massive stars for a given stellar mass; •the star formation density threshold is increased to 9.3 cm−3; •the energy input from supernovae is increased to 1051 ergs; •we include energy from radiation released by the mas- sive young stars before they explode as supernovae. Radiation pressure from massive stars can have signiﬁ- cant eﬀects on the scales that are resolved in our simulation s (Nath & Silk 2009; Murray et al. 2011). Massive stars typi- cally produce 1050ergs of energy 
sive stars typi- cally produce 1050ergs of energy per M⊙, yet this couples only weakly to the ISM (Freyer et al. 2006). To mimic this ineﬃciency, we inject a fraction of the energy as thermal en- ergy in the surrounding gas but do notturn oﬀ cooling (for details see Brook et al. 2012). Such thermal energy injectio n is highly ineﬃcient at the spatial and temporal resolution o f cosmological simulations, andis rapidlyradiatedaway(Ka tz 1992) This feedback is even less eﬃcient at low resolution. F
feedback is even less eﬃcient at low resolution. Following a parameter search designed to match the stellar mass–halo mass resolution from halo abundance matching (Moster et al. 2010), we inject 17.5% of radiation pressure to the surrounding gas as thermal energy in the lower reso- lution (HM) simulation, but only 10% in the higher resolu- tion runs(LM).

The HM LF and HM MF simulations use the same initial conditions and each simulated galaxy has an abso- luteV-band magnitude MV≈ −20.8 implying a luminos- ityL≈0.8L⋆.

HM MF was analysed in Macci` o et al. (2012). LM LF and LM MF use diﬀerent initial conditions of similar halo mass. They are selected because each has MV≈ −19. The LM LF initial conditions run with MaG- ICC feedback have MV≈ −16.2. To summarize the internal p
edback have MV≈ −16.2. To summarize the internal properties of the galaxies, the lower feedback galaxies suﬀ er from the problems of angular momentum loss that have long plagued galaxy formation simulations: dense central stell ar bulges, centrally peaked rotation curves, dark matter cusp s and too many stars relative to halo mass compared to obser- vations. The MaGICC feedback simulations result in galax- ies which match the stellar mass–halo mass relation, have slowly rising rotation curves, a
ss relation, have slowly rising rotation curves, and dark matter cores. The MaGICC feedback simulations provide signiﬁcantly better matches to the internal properties of observed disc galaxie s. 3 RESULTS To study the CGM properties of the simulated galax- ies, we ﬁnd the galaxy using the Amiga Halo Finder (Knollmann & Knebe 2009) and deﬁne its center and sys- temic velocity by the position and velocity of the particle with the lowest potential.

We may then sample the CGM at a range of impact parameters ρ. To generate surface den- sity maps of the CGM, we sum each box over 1 Mpc along the line of sight. The maximum velocity of the material in the box is |δv|<200km s−1. To estimate the speciﬁc col- umn densities of HI and OVI, we must estimate the ioniza- tion state of the gas along each sightline.

his high density, hot halo gas is a relic of the thermal feed- back implementation–the gas has had its cooling temporar- ily disabled–and that this gas is concentrated in a ∼10 kpc sphere around the galaxy. This dense, hot gas drives the out- ﬂows that populate the CGM with metal enriched material, but it represents a negligible fraction of the OVI column. We discuss in §3.3 how this dense, hot gas generates a com- parable amount of soft X-ray emission to that observed. In terms of total mass, F

(We quote 300 kpc since it is the maximum extent at which OVI maintains a 100% covering fraction in the simulations.) About half of this CGM has T <105K giving a cool gas mass that matches verywellwithpreviousempirical estimates(Prochaska et a l. 2011).

The LM MF model has a lower CGM mass in both gas and metals by about a factor of 3. The LM LF has even less (∼109M⊙) cool gas in the CGM and a negligible mass ofOVI.This model is averypoor matchtotheobservational estimates. Returning to Figure 1, one notes that the OVI gas has both a smoother and more extended distributi
s has both a smoother and more extended distribution than the HI. Again, this reﬂects the fact that the OVI gas traces a hotter and more diﬀuse phase in the halos of this galaxy. In contrast, the discrete clouds of HI are clustered more closely to the disc and are the remnant of both gas-rich mergers and cooling out of the hot halo. Maller & Bullock (2004) and Kaufmann et al. (2009) describe how gas can cool out of the hot halo. A detailed examination of the evo- lution of these cold clouds is b
ation of the evo- lution of these cold clouds is beyond the scope of this pa- per, but a preliminary investigation suggests that the clou ds both cool out of the hot halo and are entrained in the out- ﬂows. The cooling mechanism may be a numerical artifact of SPH whereby particles approach each other due to ran- dom excursions and thus create a slightly higher density, which makes them cool faster.

It remains for future simulations using more detailed radiati ve transfer to see if such condensations are an artifact of the SPH hydrodynamics scheme.

The results for OVI are more discordant; the CGM of HMLF underpredicts the observed OVI column densi- ties by nearly an order of magnitude at all impact param- eters. In contrast, the HM MF predicts nearly 10 ×higher OVI surface densities and therefore provides a reasonable match to the observations. Furthermore, this model yields qualitatively better agreement with the HI observations. I

At lower masses, the diﬀerences between the high and lower feedback models become starker.

 Lower feedback generates gaseous halos with signiﬁcantly less oxygen. 3.2 Evolution To gain a sense of how the CGM developed, Figure 7 shows the evolution of total mass, along with stellar, OVI, cold (T <105K), and hot gas ( T >105K) masses within rvir for the simulated galaxies. The total halo mass increases by two orders of magnitude in the 2 Gyr between z= 6 and 3 in each simulation. Subsequent merger/accretion events ar e reﬂected in mass “jumps”. With lower feedback, most star formation ha

In each galaxy, hot gas develops at the same time as star formation, indicating that stellar feedback is the ini tial source of hot gas in galaxy halos. As the halo grows, accret- ing cold gas is shocked to the virial temperature, so that by z= 0, only one-third of T >105K gas at z= 0 was directly involved in a stellar feedback event. Th

The mass history of the OVI follows stellar mass in HM MF indicating that oxygen produced in supernovae readily makes its way into the halo as a hot gas.

emains constant indicating that the lower feedback is unable to drive metal-enriched outﬂows. It is surprising that even though the feedback imple- mentation is thermal, the MaGICC feedback does not lead to more hot gas, but rather more cold gas. As described ear- lier, this is because some cold gas gets entrained in outﬂows and there is rapid cooling of halo gas. We speculate that the similar amount of hot gas in HM LF and HM MF that have diﬀerent feedback implementations is representative of s
nt feedback implementations is representative of some maximum amount of hot gas that can exist in a halo before the gas cools; a larger parameter search is required to address this question.108109101010111012Mass [M⊙]HM_LFLow Feedback HM_MFMaGICC Feedback 024681012 time [Gyr]108109101010111012Mass [M⊙]LM_LF 024681012 time [Gyr]LM_MF Mvir fb=0.16 MstarMgas,hot Mgas,cold 1e3 MOVI5432 1 0z 5432 1 0z Figure 7.

Observations of disc galaxies have detected X-ra ys

Using a naive Navarro et al. (1995) estimate of LXbased solely on bremsstrahlung cool- ing, HM MF has LX= 5.2×1039(4.4×1037) erg s−1out- side 10 (20) kpc in the 0.2-2.0 keV energy range. Even with the large amount of mass in the halo, the gas remains too diﬀuse to emit signiﬁcant X-rays. It is intriguing that the X-

It is intriguing that the X-ray luminosity from inside 10 kpc, LX= 5.8×1040, is similar to the observed diﬀuse, soft X-ray emission for an LB= 2.4×1010L⊙galaxy (e.g. Strickland et al. 2004), but a detailed study of this emission is beyond the scope of this work. 4 CONCLUSIONS We have studied CGM gas in high resolution galaxy for- mation simulations. The stellar feedback is constrained us - ing the stellar mass–halo mass relationship. This constrai nt leads to a stellar feed
tionship. This constrai nt leads to a stellar feedback implementation that decreases star formation and ejects hot, metal-enriched gas into the CGM. Inside the galaxies, the stellar feedback results in slowly rising rotation curves, ﬂattened dark matter densit y proﬁlesandHImass-Luminosity,baryonicTully–Fisher rel a- tions, and mass-metallicity relations that resemble obser ved galaxies (Brook et al. 2012). We compared these galaxy models to one with more standard feedback implementation (Stinso
with more standard feedback implementation (Stinson et al. 2010; Scannapieco et al. 2012). The lower c/circlecopyrt0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000–000 MaGICC Halos 7 feedback simulations match none of these commonly ob- served internal properties of galaxies. An examination of t he CGM in our model reveals that: •The MaGICC feedback implementation produces ex- tended, metal-enriched gaseous coronae that extend to impact parameters of ∼300 kpc, even around low mass (L∗∼0.1L⊙) halos. These results match 
nd low mass (L∗∼0.1L⊙) halos. These results match observed absorp- tion line features (Wakker & Savage 2009; Prochaska et al. 2011; Tumlinson et al. 2011). •The hot coronae extend beyond rvir, though most of their mass remains contained within rvirof the simulated galaxies. The coronae extend furthest outside rvirin low mass systems. •A reasonably strong feedback implementation, com- pared with those in the literature (our “lower feedback” case), is insuﬃcienttomatchHIabsorption features at z= 0
 is insuﬃcienttomatchHIabsorption features at z= 0 and severely underestimates OVI, performing particularly poorly in low mass ( ∼0.1 L⋆) simulations. •The amount of hot gas in the LF and MF runs did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly, but rather: – (i) The MaGICC feedback ejected ten times more oxygen out of the disc than the lower feedback in the high mass case and a factor of 104more in the low mass case. – (ii) The MaGICC feedback halo contains ten times the cold gas as the lower feedback case in both h
 the cold gas as the lower feedback case in both high and low mass simulations. The cold gas results from cooling out of the hot halo gas and cold gas entrained in outﬂows. •The MaGICC feedback simulations match the observed HI and OVI absorption columns at a range of masses. •The total mass of the coronae is several times higher than the stellar mass in the simulated MaGICC feedback galaxies. Thus, the simulations of individual galaxies pre - dict that the “missing baryons” are found in the CGM
ct that the “missing baryons” are found in the CGM of galaxies. In our simulations, we only considered galaxies de- ﬁned as star forming by Prochaska et al. (2011) and Tumlinson et al. (2011). One of the key results of those works is the absence of OVI detection in quiescent galax- ies. Our simulations are unable to address the question of what happens to the OVI when galaxies stop forming stars. Our examination focused on the radial distribution of HI and OVI gas in the CGM of a simulated L≈L⋆ 
 of HI and OVI gas in the CGM of a simulated L≈L⋆ galaxy and compared these results to observed surface den- sity proﬁles. There are, of course, additional observables related to the entire population of OVI absorbers identi- ﬁed in quasar absorption line studies (e.g. Danforth & Shull 2008; Thom & Chen 2008a; Tripp et al. 2008); any truly successful model must also reproduce these resuts. One key constraint is the observed distribution of line-widths (a.k.a. Doppler parameters or b-values) for 
idths (a.k.a. Doppler parameters or b-values) for the OVI gas (Thom & Chen 2008a; Tripp et al. 2008) which gauge, in a statistical fashion, the contributions of thermal broade n- ing, turbulence, and gas dynamics to the motions of the gas. On average, the b-values for OVI absorbers are substantial (b >20km s−1) and appear to correlate with the strength of OVI absorption. This has posed a considerable challenge to models where OVI is predominantly photoionized (e.g. Oppenheimer & Dav´ e2009), as 
 photoionized (e.g. Oppenheimer & Dav´ e2009), as suchgas has asmall thermal width.Anothervaluablekinematic constraintis thecommon observation of co-aligned HI and OVI absorption relativeto a common redshift (approximately half of observed OVI systems; Thom & Chen 2008b). Indeed, this appears to be at odds with the apparent separation of strong HI absorp- tion (at smaller radii) with the extended OVI absorption of our modeled CGM. On the other hand, we do observe non- negligible HI absorption to
nd, we do observe non- negligible HI absorption to large radii (Figure 4) which may trace the OVI gas. A proper comparison of our model with these observables will require the generation and detailed analysis of line-proﬁles, as well as the examination of the CGM for galaxies spanninga wide range of masses. This will be the focus of our next paper, which will consider whether the extended CGM of z∼0 galaxies can reproduce all of theobserved statistics for OVIas argued byProchaska et al. (2011). 
stics for OVIas argued byProchaska et al. (2011). We further note that the HI surface densities at ρ < 50kpc are suﬃciently large that the CGM will yield signiﬁ- cant absorption from lower ionization states of heavy metal s (e.g. MgII, SiII, SiIII). A proper estimate of the column den - sities for these ions, however, will require a full treatmen t of radiative transfer (i.e. to account for self-shielding by o pti- cally thick HI gas). The fact that the resultant extended, metal enriched CGM aro
hat the resultant extended, metal enriched CGM around our simulated galaxies matches the observa- tions over a wide range of mass provides strong support for a vigorous baryon cycle in which outﬂows and subsequent cooling of halo gas play a key role in forming disc galaxies.

The formation and growth of galaxies over time is connected to the growth of the halos in which they form. The advent of large g
he halos in which they form. The advent of large galaxy surveys as well as high-resolution cosmological simulations has provided a new window into the statistical relation- ship between galaxies and halos and its evolution. Here we dene this galaxy{halo connection as the multi-variate distribution of galaxy and halo properties that can be derived from observations and simulations. This connection provides a key test of physical galaxy formation mod- els; it also plays an essential role in const
mod- els; it also plays an essential role in constraints of cosmological models using galaxy surveys and in elucidating the properties of dark matter using galaxies. We review techniques for inferring the galaxy{halo con- nection and the insights that have arisen from these approaches. Some things we have learned are that galaxy formation eciency is a strong function of halo mass; at its peak in halos around a pivot halo mass of 1012M, less than 20% of the available baryons have turned into st
n 20% of the available baryons have turned into stars by the present day; the intrinsic scatter in galaxy stellar mass is small, less than 0.2 dex at a given halo mass above this pivot mass; below this pivot mass galaxy stellar mass is a strong function of halo mass; the majority of stars over cosmic time were formed in a narrow region around this pivot mass. We also highlight key open questions about how galaxies and halos are connected, including understanding the correlations with secondary p

INTRODUCTION In modern cosmological models, 5=6 of the mass in the Universe is made of dark matter (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016). This dark matter forms the skeleton on which galaxies form, evolve, and merge. In the context of this model, which is now well established from a wide range of observations, uctuations in the matter distribution were created in the rst 
 the matter distribution were created in the rst fraction of a second during an inationary period. Gravitational instability grew these uctuations over time. Gas and dark matter were initially well mixed; as the universe evolved, gas was able to dissipate and fell to the centers of dark matter halos. For large 2 Wechsler & Tinker enough dark matter halos, gas was able to cool, form stars, and form a protogalaxy. The power spectrum of matter indicates that small objects should form rst, and h
dicates that small objects should form rst, and halos should grow and merge over time. Galaxies within these halos then continue to form stars ( in situ) as well as to grow through merging ( ex situ ), because their dark matter halos merge. Energetic processes within galaxies impact their surroundings after they form, as various kinds of feedback, which inuences future gas accretion and star formation. In this context, clearly the growth, internal properties, and spatial distribution of galax-
nal properties, and spatial distribution of galax- ies are likely to be closely connected to the growth, internal properties, and spatial distri- bution of dark matter halos. Very simply, the luminous matter in the Universe is arranged in galaxies, and in a cold dark matter model, the dark matter in the Universe is arranged in dark matter halos. The physical and statistical connection between them is the focus of this review. We denote this the galaxy{halo connection , which in detail can refer 
alaxy{halo connection , which in detail can refer to the full multivariate distribution of properties of halos and the galaxies that form within them. Elucidating this connection is a stepping stone to answering several of the largest questions in astrophysics and cosmology today. These include the following: Understanding the physics of galaxy formation : How does gas cool in galaxies, how do stars form, and what determines the dominant feedback processes? How can we best infer physics from av
k processes? How can we best infer physics from available observations including the spatial distribution of galaxies as a function of their properties? Statistical constraints on the galaxy{halo connection can eectively synthesize diverse datasets and provide essential input into these questions. Inferring cosmological parameters : A new generation of deep, wide-area imaging and spectroscopic surveys has substantial constraining power on cosmological models, including the power to distinguish
logical models, including the power to distinguish between a cosmological constant, dark energy, and modied gravity; to measure the mass of the neutrino; and to constrain the inationary potential. To make full use of these measurements on the widest range of scales, we need to understand how to robustly marginalize over the uncertainties in the galaxy{halo connection. Probing the properties and distribution of dark matter : How can we infer the evolution of the matter distribution and the pro
e evolution of the matter distribution and the properties of dark matter halos us- ing surveys of galaxies? Measurements of galaxies and of their spatial distribution give us the potential to map out the distribution of dark matter as well as to distin- guish between models of dark matter. These observations are generally sensitive to combinations of both the dark matter particle and the galaxy{halo connection. The galaxy{halo connection as a concept started with the earliest understanding of mo
cept started with the earliest understanding of modern galaxy formation within the framework of cold dark matter (CDM) models, as did the understanding that the spatial distribution of galaxies can lead to insight into their formation properties. For example, Peebles (1980) discussed the two-point statistics of galaxies, and early work recognized that massive galaxies and clusters should have dierent clustering properties than average galaxies (Davis & Peebles 1983; Bahcall & Soneira 1983; Klyp
Davis & Peebles 1983; Bahcall & Soneira 1983; Klypin & Kopylov 1983; Kaiser 1984), and that measuring these clustering properties could provide information about the masses of the dark matter halos that they lived in, because of the strong dependence of halo clustering on halo mass (Bardeen et al. 1986; Mo & White 1996). It also was recognized early on that this relationship could be complex and scale dependent (e.g. Klypin, Primack & Holtzman 1996; Jenkins et al. 1998). However, it was not unti
96; Jenkins et al. 1998). However, it was not until the late 1990s that cosmological simulations were able to www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 3 resolve the substructures within larger dark matter halos. At about the same time, the rst large galaxy surveys were beginning. The APM survey (Baugh 1996) was the rst to measure the galaxy correlation function for a large sample of galaxies. Kravtsov & Klypin (1999) and Col n et al. (1999) were able to resolve substructures in simu
 (1999) were able to resolve substructures in simulations of cosmological volumes, and they measured approximately power-law correlation functions that were consistent with measurements from APM. This eld was then revolutionized with the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS; Colless et al. 2001) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS; York et al. 2000). For the rst time, these surveys were able to measure the spatial clustering properties of large samples of galaxies, which allowed for 
s of large samples of galaxies, which allowed for the separation into their physical properties such as luminosity and color or stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). Pioneering detections of galaxies at high redshift (Adelberger et al. 1998) also enabled the rst studies of galaxy clustering at these epochs. These two joint revolutions, (a)the advent of numerical simulations that could resolve the dark matter structures and substructures hosting galaxies, over volumes large enough to measu
sting galaxies, over volumes large enough to measure their spatial clustering properties and (b)the advent of large galaxy surveys, that could identify large samples of galaxies and measure their spatial clustering, including over a range of redshifts, have led to a new set of approaches to statistically connect these two distributions and infer the connection between galaxies and halos, that has ourished over the last15 years.1The primary focus of this review is on the inference of this stati

We will highlight (a)theoretical approaches to the problem (b)the primary insights that we have gained from studying the galaxy{halo connection and (c)outstanding issues.

000; Cooray & Sheth 2002), a method for analytically calculating the non-linear clustering of dark matter, using the properties of dark matter halos (including their abundance and spatial clustering) as the basic unit. The halo model can be combined with models of the galaxy{halo connection to predict galaxy clustering. Elucidating the statistical connection between galaxies and halos relies on another major advance of the last two decades: the establishment of a standard cosmological model, CD
stablishment of a standard cosmological model, CDM, in which the universe consists of 5% baryonic matter, 25% dark matter, and 70% dark energy. The parameters of this model are now known to high precision (Betoule et al. 2014; Planck Collaboration et al. 2016; DES Collaboration et al. 2017; Alam et al. 2017); this allows robust predictions, using numerical simulations, for the growth of structure and the formation and evolution of dark matter halos. Although this review relies heavily on basic 
los. Although this review relies heavily on basic predictions of the CDM model and the properties of dark matter halos, these are well-reviewed elsewhere; see for example Frenk & White (2012) and Primack (2012).

In x8 we summarize the key aspects of the galaxy{halo connection that have been understood from the last decade of studies, assess the outlook for such studies over the next decade, including how they will be inuenced by upcoming surveys, and highlight outstanding questions for future work. 2. MODELS OF THE GALAXY{HALO CONNECTION In this review we distinguish between two basic approaches to modeling the galaxy{halo connection, 
pproaches to modeling the galaxy{halo connection, empirical modeling , which uses data to constrain a specic set of parameters describing the connection at a given epoch or as a function of time, and physical modeling , which either directly simulates or parameterizes the physics of galaxy formation such as gas cooling, star formation, and feedback. A schematic summary of these approaches to the galaxy{halo connection is given in Figure 1 , which gives an example of the galaxy and dark matter d
h gives an example of the galaxy and dark matter distributions for one such model, and outlines the key elements of various approaches. We note that in practice these modeling approaches are more of a continuum: as one moves to the right in this gure, one is assuming less physics directly from the model itself, and has more exibility to constrain the unknown aspects of the galaxy{halo connection directly with data, but the models are also less predictive and less directly connected to the phys
predictive and less directly connected to the physical prescriptions. In general, approaches towards the right are also signicantly less expensive computationally than the more physical approaches. We begin inx2.1 by reviewing the concept of a dark matter halo. We then review current approaches to empirical modeling of the galaxy{halo connection in x2.2, including abundance matching, the halo occupation distribution and conditional luminosity function, and models which connect galaxies over tim
nction, and models which connect galaxies over time to their histories. In x2.3, we review approaches to physical modeling of galaxy formation, including hydrodynamical simulations and semi- analytic modeling, highlighting areas of synergy with empirical approaches. 2.1. Preliminaries: What is a halo? In the modern theory of cosmological structure formation, dark matter halos are the basic unit into which matter collapses. Schematically, halos can be thought of as gravitationally bound regions o
n be thought of as gravitationally bound regions of matter that have decoupled from the Hubble expansion and collapsed. In numerical simulations they are generally dened with masses and radii specied by a given overdensity: Mvir=4 3R3 virm. The denition of  chosen in the literature varies (with values around 200); here unless otherwise specied we use the denition given by Bryan & Norman (1998), which characterizes the overdensity predicted for a virialized region that has undergone sphe

Within the radius of a dark matter halo there may be multiple, distinct peaks in the density eld with virialized clumps of dark matter gravitationally bound to them. These subhalos are smaller than the hosthalo, and they orbit within the gravitational potential of the host halo. Resolving and tracking such objects is critical for making proper comparisons to the observed distribution of galaxies. We note that the denition of halo radius given a
 We note that the denition of halo radius given above, though common in the literature, may not be the most physically motivated denition of the boundary of a dark matter halo. Diemer, More & Kravtsov (2013) have emphasized that the commonly used denitions of halo boundaries can lead to unphysical interpretations about halo mass accretion histories. For example, measuring halo growth using Mvirwill lead one to infer signicant halo growth which is due just to the halo boundary being dened to
h is due just to the halo boundary being dened to larger radii with time, which they term \pseudoevolution". Recently several authors have suggested an alternative concept, the \splashback" radius, which species the radius at which matter that is bound to the halo can orbit to after rst collapse (Diemer & Kravtsov 2014; More, Diemer & Kravtsov 2015; Adhikari, Dalal & Chamberlain 2014; Manseld, Kravtsov & Diemer 2017); this radius may also be more co-incident with the radius at which gas can 
more co-incident with the radius at which gas can shock heat, and at which infalling 6 Wechsler & Tinker substructures can start being stripped by their host halos. Because this has not been yet widely adopted in most of the studies we review, we do not adopt this convention here, but we note that it may change some of the detailed physical interpretation of results presented (it is not expected to change the qualitative conclusions). 2.2. Empirical models of the galaxy{halo connection The revol
cal models of the galaxy{halo connection The revolution in our understanding of the galaxy{halo connection has been driven by new physical insights as well as signicant input from simple empirical models that connect observations from galaxy surveys to the predictions of the properties and evolution of dark matter halos in cosmological simulations. Here, we generally assume that the basic proper- ties of dark matter halos are known for a given cosmological model. They can be predicted directly 
osmological model. They can be predicted directly using an N-body simulation, or using tting functions that summarize the proper- ties of halos in such a simulation. To predict clustering statistics for example, one wants to know the abundance of dark matter halos (the \halo mass function"; see e.g. Sheth, Mo & Tormen 2001; Tinker et al. 2008b), their clustering properties (the \halo bias"; e.g. Sheth & Tormen 1999; Tinker et al. 2010, which can be a function of mass, redshift, and scale), the 
 be a function of mass, redshift, and scale), the radial distribution of matter or substructures within halos, and the velocity distribution of dark matter or of substructures within halos. In most of the discussion below, we assume these predictions are made with gravity-only N-body simulations; we explicitly discuss the impact of hydrodynamics and feedback where relevant. 2.2.1. Abundance Matching. Perhaps the simplest assumption one could make about the galaxy halo connection is that the most
 about the galaxy halo connection is that the most massive galaxies live in the most massive dark matter halos. This basic approach is generally called \abundance matching" in the literature (the most massive galaxy lives in the most massive halo; the second most massive galaxy lives in the next most massive halo, etc.) The earliest versions of this assumption, applied before there were robust simulations that resolved cosmological structure within halos, assumed only one galaxy per halo (e.g. W
in halos, assumed only one galaxy per halo (e.g. Wechsler et al. 1998; Col n et al. 1999; Kravtsov & Klypin 1999; Moustakas & Somerville 2002). However, CDM predicts structure on all scales, and thus predicts that dark matter halos host distinct substructures. These substructures (above a certain mass) are expected to host galaxies. A simple ansatz is thus that each halo and subhalo hosts a galaxy, with the mass or luminosity of a galaxy matched by abundance to the mass or velocity of the dark
d by abundance to the mass or velocity of the dark matter (sub)halo in which it lives; this is often referred to as subhalo abundance matching (\AM" or \SHAM") in the literature (Kravtsov et al. 2004; Tasitsiomi et al. 2004; Vale & Ostriker 2004). Once this assumption is made, one can calculate a range of statistics for the model. Although the earliest versions of these models were sometimes referred to as zero parameter models, there are in fact a set of assumptions or parameters that need to b
 a set of assumptions or parameters that need to be specied. The two most important are: (1) what halo property is best matched to what galaxy property? and (2) what is the scatter between these properties? It was realized quickly that while subhalos are rapidly stripped of their outer material after being accreted into a larger dark matter halo, galaxy stripping starts much later (Nagai & Kravtsov 2005). Thus, one might expect a model which matches galaxies to halo properties at the time they 
ches galaxies to halo properties at the time they are accreted into their host halos to provide a better match to a luminosity-selected galaxy sample; this was demonstrated byConroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov (2006). Later work has investigated several alternative possibilities for the matching proxy, discussed further in x4.1. However, even in www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 7 the presence of scatter between galaxy and halo masses, abundance matching is best thought of as a non-para
bundance matching is best thought of as a non-parametric technique that directly connects the stellar mass function to the halo mass function (Tasitsiomi et al. 2004). This can be done by deconvolving the scatter, as described by Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler (2010); see in particular x3.3.1 of that work for the equations governing this deconvolution .2The consequences of and constraints on scatter are discussed further in x4.3. We note that modern versions of abundance matching models generally r
 versions of abundance matching models generally require high-resolution simulations; they depend on resolved substructure and on accurate merger trees to track the path of halos at least to the point in time that they started being tidally stripped. 2.2.2. The stellar mass/halo mass relation (SHMR). Abundance matching can be used to determine the typical galaxy stellar mass at a given halo mass, or galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation, which we abbreviate as SHMR. An alternative to inferring th
abbreviate as SHMR. An alternative to inferring this SHMR from non-parametric abundance matching is to parameterize it and constrain the parameters (e.g. Moster et al. 2010). The SHMR for central galaxies is shown in Figure 2 , as constrained by non-parametric abundance matching, as inferred by a parametric SHMR constrained by abundance and clustering data, and as derived by a number of other methods that will be described below. The basic shape of this relation derives from the mismatch between
of this relation derives from the mismatch between the halo mass function and the galaxy stellar mass function or luminosity function, which declines rapidly below typical galaxies and has a much shallower faint-end slope than the halo mass function. One can see several clear features in this relation, which are identied consistently using any of the methods used to constrain it. First, the peak eciency of galaxy formation is always quite low: if all halos are assumed to host the universal bar
if all halos are assumed to host the universal baryon fraction   b= mof 17%, at its maximum, these results show that just 20{30% of baryons have turned into stars, resulting in a SHMR that peaks at just a few percent. This maximum galaxy formation eciency occurs around the mass of halos hosting typical Lgalaxies like the Milky Way, around 1012M; we refer to this as the pivot mass. At higher and lower masses, galaxy formation is even less ecient. Roughly, the stellar mass of central scales a

Images of typical galaxies that populate halos of a given mass are shown below the relation.SHMR: The stellar-to-halo mass relation. This can be predicted with models of galaxy formation, inferred from parameterized models, or measured directly. This decrease in the eciency of star formation is a signature of strong feedback pro- cesses from the formation of stars and black holes. It i
 from the formation of stars and black holes. It is likely due to combination of a number of processes: at high mass, AGN feedback can act to heat halo gas and limit future star formation (Silk & Rees 1998; Croton et al. 2006); at low mass, feedback from massive stars is believed to be important in driving winds that eject gas, or prevent it from coming into a galaxy (Dekel & Silk 1986; Hopkins, Quataert & Murray 2012); at even lower masses, galaxies can be too small to hold onto their gas durin
xies can be too small to hold onto their gas during the reionization period around z6 (Bullock, Kravtsov & Weinberg 2000). We discuss the constraints on this relation in more detail in Sections 5 and 6, but here we note that many dierent techniques are telling the same basic story. Below some threshold halo mass, galaxies will no longer be able to form at all. The smallest known galaxies, ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, have measured dynamical masses in their inner regions larger than a few times 
es in their inner regions larger than a few times 107M, which is most likely equivalent to halo virial masses of larger than 109M. The exact value of the minimum mass at which a halo can host a galaxy is still somewhat uncertain, as is the slope of and scatter in SHMR for 2A code to implement this procedure is available at http://bitbucket.org/yymao/abundancematching 8 Wechsler & Tinker AGNStellar WindsReionizationSupernovae Figure 2: The galaxy stellar mass-to-halo mass ratio of central galax

The gure (based on data compiled in Behroozi et al. 2018) shows constraints from a number of dierent methods: direct abundance matching (Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler 2010; Reddick et al. 2013; Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy 2013a); \parameterized abundance matching," in which this relationship is parameterized and then those parameters are t with the stellar mass function and possibly other observables (Guo et al. 2010; Wang & Jing 20

We note that the SHMR generally parameterizes Mas a function of Mh. Due to scatter in these two quantities, quantifying the galaxy{halo connection with the mean halo mass in bins ofM| as done observationally | does not yield the same mean relation.

A pop- ular way to describe the relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos is through the Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), which species the probability distribution for www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 9 the number of galaxies meeting some criteria (for example, a luminosity or stellar mass threshold) in a halo, generally conditioned on its mass, P(NjM). Typically this PDF is 
tioned on its mass, P(NjM). Typically this PDF is quantied separately for the central galaxies of halos and the satellite galaxies that orbit within the halos. For the former, a Bernoulli distribution is assumed, while for satellites a Poisson distribution is assumed. Under these assumptions the standard HOD is thus fully characterized by its mean occupation number hNjMi; we discuss this assumption in Section 4.6. In principle, the HOD can be a function of properties other than halo mass; we di

The connection between modern halo occupation models and measurements of galaxy clustering started to be explored by several workers in the early 2000s (e.g. Peacock & Smith 2000; Seljak 2000; Benson et al. 2000; Wechsler et al. 2001; Scoccimarro et al. 2001; Berlind & Weinberg 2002; Bullock, Wechsler & Somerville 2002), and is now well constrained for a wide range of galaxy samples. The functional form of the HOD fo

This was rst studied in detail by Kravtsov et al. (2004), who found that the HOD for samples of subhalos is well-described by a power law of subhalos NM, with the addition of a central galaxy; for a given threshold on galaxy stellar mass, a typical central galaxy can be found in halos 10{30 times less massive than the 
 found in halos 10{30 times less massive than the halos that host satellite galaxies of the same stellar mass (examples are shown in the next section). This rough functional form has been shown to hold for luminosity-threshold or stellar mass-threshold samples of galaxies. In general, such an HOD can be described by 3{5 parameters for a given galaxy sample. Commonly used parameterizations are given in Zheng et al. (2005) (their equations [1] and [3]) and Reddick et al. (2013) (their equations 9 
[3]) and Reddick et al. (2013) (their equations 9 and 10). For more complicated galaxy samples (e.g. selected by star formation rates, colors, or emission lines), the functional form of the HOD can be signicantly more complicated (e.g., Skibba & Sheth 2009). The conditional luminosity function (CLF) and conditional stellar mass function (CSMF) go one step further to describe the full distribution of galaxy luminosities for a given halo mass.

In general, this parameterization distinguishes between central galaxies, which are usually assumed to follow a lognormal distribution of stellar masses or luminosities at xed halo mass, and satellite galaxies, which are usually assumed to follow a Schechter function (Schechter 1976) whose parameters scale with halo mass. A concise review of the equations governing the CLF can be found in x3.7 of van den Bosch et al. (2013). For both the CLF and the HOD, model predictions can be made in two 
and the HOD, model predictions can be made in two ways. Both models specify the number of galaxies per halo, thus one can populate halos identied in an N-body simulation using a Monte Carlo approach, and `measure' observables from the resulting mock galaxy catalog. Alternatively, both of these frameworks can be combined with an analytic halo model of dark matter clustering to make predictions for some statistics analytically (see, e.g., Tinker et al. 2005 and van den Bosch et al. 2013). The CLF
t al. 2005 and van den Bosch et al. 2013). The CLF and HOD parameterize the galaxy{halo connection dierently, but in spirit they quantify the same thing. Either method can be used to quantify the other (see, e.g., Leauthaud et al. 10 Wechsler & Tinker 2011). HOD: Halo occupation distribution. This species the probability distribution for the number of galaxies in a halo, generally conditioned on its mass,P(NjM). CLF: Conditional luminosity function. This species the luminosity function of gal
tion. This species the luminosity function of galaxies (both centrals and satellites) conditioned on halo mass.2.2.4. Empirical Modeling of Galaxy Formation Histories. Somewhat intermediate to the abundance matching and HOD/CLF models that describe a galaxy population at a xed epoch and the full semi-analytic approach described in x2.3.2 is a class of models that trace galaxies within their dark matter halos over time, but directly constrain the galaxy{halo connection at each epoch. Conroy & W
e galaxy{halo connection at each epoch. Conroy & Wechsler (2009) developed a simple approach along these lines using abundance matching at each epoch to determine the SHMR, combined with the typical mass accretion histories to connect halos through time, to determine typ- ical galaxy accretion histories and star formation histories across cosmic time. Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy (2013a), and Moster, Naab & White (2013) extended this work using simulated mass accretion histories (following on ear
mulated mass accretion histories (following on earlier work from Yang et al. 2012 with analytic approximations for halo properties) as well as updated constraints from the evo- lution of the galaxy stellar mass function and galaxy star formation rates to put strong constraints on the typical trajectories of galaxies through time. This approach is being taken further by many workers (Becker 2015; Rodr guez-Puebla et al. 2016; Cohn 2017; Moster, Naab & White 2018; Behroozi et al. 2018); instead 
Naab & White 2018; Behroozi et al. 2018); instead of parameterizing the connection between galaxy stellar mass and halo properties at a given epoch, one can parameterize for example the relationship between the galaxy star formation rate and the halo mass accretion rate, and then trace these histories through time using simulated merger histories. This is a powerful approach which allows one in principle to use a range of data to constrain the model, and to make predictions for the distribution 
del, and to make predictions for the distribution of galaxy star formation histories as well as their statistical properties at any epoch. In general this approach also requires high-resolution simulations to construct robust merger trees of dark matter halos and to trace the evolution of subhalos. 2.3. Physical models of galaxy formation Physical models of galaxy formation attempt to either directly simulate or to model the basic physical processes in galaxy formation. The current status and ap
ses in galaxy formation. The current status and approaches of these models, including both hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models, were recently reviewed by Somerville & Dav e (2015). Here we primarily focus on the connection to and contrast with empirical models, as well as the interplay between these various approaches. 2.3.1. Hydrodynamical Simulations. Hydrodynamical simulations model galaxy formation by solving the equations of gravity and hydrodynamics in a cosmological conte
 gravity and hydrodynamics in a cosmological context, incor- porating such processes as gas cooling, stellar-feedback driven winds, and feedback from black holes and supernovae, and in some cases magnetic elds and cosmic rays, and tracing the properties of dark matter, gas, and stars in given resolution elements over time. Al- though they contain extensive physical prescriptions, they cannot simulate the full range of scales needed for galaxy formation in a cosmological context without some par
rmation in a cosmological context without some parameteriza- tions below the resolution scale, generally termed \subgrid physics." These subgrid physics parameterizations need to be tuned, either through direct tests with observations or by comparison to constraints with empirical models that connect observations to dark matter halos. Although there is still signicant uncertainty in the details, there has been dramatic progress in producing realistic galaxy populations in hydrodynamical simulat
istic galaxy populations in hydrodynamical simulations over the www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 11 past decade, due to increasing resolution as well as improved physical models for star formation and feedback, based on insight from a wide range of observations. These models provide our best understanding of the complex interplay between the physical processes of galaxy formation, and they can thus be used to inform and test the assumptions of empirical models. The earliest stud
assumptions of empirical models. The earliest studies of the halo occupation in hydrodynamical simulations were performed before it was well-constrained by empirical models (White, Hernquist & Springel 2001; Pearce et al. 2001; Berlind et al. 2003), following earlier work looking at the occupation in a semi-analytic model by Benson et al. (2000). These studies provided useful insight into early modeling approaches for the HOD, e.g. Zheng et al. (2005) used smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulat
2005) used smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations and semi-analytic models to propose forms for the HOD and CLF that were later constrained with the best-available clustering data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. More recently, Simha et al. (2012) and Chaves-Montero et al. (2016) have tested the key assumptions of the subhalo abundance matching approach with modern cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The interplay goes both ways: in recent years, measuring the galaxy{halo connection 
ecent years, measuring the galaxy{halo connection either through the SHMR or the halo occupation in these simulations and comparing to constraints obtained from empirical models and/or combinations of data has become a stan- dard test for cosmological hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytic models (Genel et al. 2014; Vogelsberger et al. 2014; Schaye et al. 2015). Because these models are compu- tationally expensive (generally, at least an order of magnitude more CPU time to simulate a given
der of magnitude more CPU time to simulate a given volume than dark matter only simulations), the SHMR and other parameteriza- tions of the galaxy{halo connection provide very useful intermediate targets that can be easier to match than full forward modeling of the entire galaxy population and comparing directly to the range of observables that have been used to constrain it. This can be done for full cosmological simulations (e.g. Crain et al. 2015), or one can even run a small set of high-reso
015), or one can even run a small set of high-resolution resimulations and evaluate whether the typical galaxy mass agrees with that inferred from empirical models (Stinson et al. 2013; Munshi et al. 2013). Below, we review comparisons between these models and current empirical constraints. 2.3.2. Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation (White & Frenk 1991; Kaumann, White & Guiderdoni 1993; Somerville & Primack 1999; Cole et al. 2000; Bower et al. 2006
 Primack 1999; Cole et al. 2000; Bower et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2013) aim to model the same basic processes of galaxy formation in a computationally ecient manner, by approximating the various physical processes with analytic prescriptions that are traced through the merging history of dark matter halos. In current models, these prescriptions are most often traced through merger trees extracted from N-body simulations. Although these models are signicantly less computationally expensive than hy
ignicantly less computationally expensive than hydrodynamical simulations, they generally have a large number (10{30) of parameters and fully exploring this parameter space has remained a challenge. These prescriptions also necessarily make simplifying assumptions, that need to be continually tested both with full hydrodynamical simulations and with data. Several recent studies have used Monte Carlo Markov chain techniques to directly constrain the semi-analytic model parameter space with data 
the semi-analytic model parameter space with data (Henriques et al. 2009; Lu et al. 2011, 2014; Henriques et al. 2015). Fully constraining these models with clustering data and other spatial statisics is still challenging due to the large parameter space and computational expense. As an alternative, the SHMR and other aspects of the parameterized galaxy{halo connection can provide useful intermediate steps to test the agreement of models with a wide range of data.SAM: Semi-analytic model 12 Wech
ide range of data.SAM: Semi-analytic model 12 Wechsler & Tinker 2.4. Complementarity between approaches One of the most encouraging aspects of the current state of galaxy formation modeling is that each of the approaches outlined above is increasingly being used to inform the oth- ers: more direct physical models can be used to inform and test the parameterizations and assumptions of empirical approaches, and empirical constraints can be used to eciently synthesize diverse constraints from data
eciently synthesize diverse constraints from data and pin down uncertainties in the physical pa- rameterizations. At present, due to the computational expense of more physical models, empirical models also are more widely used in studies that jointly constrain the galaxy{halo connection with cosmological parameters. Empirical models are also important for cases in which one wants to marginalize over possible uncertainty in the galaxy{halo connection in order to robustly infer cosmological param
tion in order to robustly infer cosmological parameters or uncertain dark matter physics. 3. MEASUREMENTS THAT INFORM THE GALAXY{HALO CONNECTION In the previous section we discussed both empirical and physical models for the galaxy{halo connection, and the interplay between them. Here, we review the most important measure- ments that are currently used to inform the galaxy{halo connection: galaxy abundances (x3.1), galaxy clustering ( x3.2), group and cluster catalogs ( x3.3), weak gravitational
p and cluster catalogs ( x3.3), weak gravitational lensing (x3.4), and additional observables including spatial statistics and scaling relations ( x3.5). For a given cosmological model and galaxy formation model, the abundance of objects, the relationship between satellites and centrals, and the spatial distribution of galaxies are related through their galaxy{halo connection. This is true for any galaxy{halo connection, whether it derives from physical models or a parameterized functional form.
hysical models or a parameterized functional form. In general, modeling approaches that make more physical assumptions (towards the left in Figure 1 ) are more predictive than more data-driven approaches. However, some empirical models make specic assumptions such that when we use them to describe one or a small set of observables, they immediately make predictions for a large set of other observables. 3.1. Galaxy abundance Given the assumption that galaxy properties and halo properties are clo
that galaxy properties and halo properties are closely connected, the most important constraint on the galaxy{halo connection for a given cosmological model (which in turn predicts the abundance of dark matter halos) is the abundance of galaxies as a function of stellar mass or luminosity, i.e., the stellar mass function (SMF) or the luminosity function. The SMF inferred from the measurements of galaxy abundance in the local universe is now a very statistically precise measurement(Bell et al. 20
y statistically precise measurement(Bell et al. 2003; Li & White 2009; Baldry et al. 2012; Bernardi et al. 2017), but there are still a number of important systematic issues that impact its normalization and mass scaling and can have consequences for the galaxy{halo connection and its interpretation. Constraints on the evolution of galaxy stellar mass functions have also improved signicantly over the past decade (P erez-Gonz alez et al. 2005; Moustakas et al. 2013), leading to consequential i
Moustakas et al. 2013), leading to consequential improvements in the evolution of the galaxy{halo connection. As discussed inx2, abundance matching can be done directly, in a non-parametric way that reproduces the observed galaxy SMF (or the luminosity function) by construction. Alternatively, it can be done parametrically, with a function that maps halo mass|or alter- native halo properties|onto galaxy stellar mass. The free parameters are then constrained by the measurements of the SMF. www.an

The middle (orange) curve is constrained to match the stellar mass function at z= 0 (Upper Right ), whereas the other models (blue and green curves) show the sensitivity of the mass function to changes in the SHMR.

The relationship between galaxy abundance, galaxy clustering, the halo occupation, and the galaxy-to-halo mass ratio for this parameterized model is shown in Figure 3 . The parameterization used here is taken from Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler (2010), with the main features being characteristic mass scales for MandMh, which constitute the location of the pivot point in the SHMR, and power-law s
on of the pivot point in the SHMR, and power-law slopes above and below the pivot point. A model that describes the abundance data well is shown in Figure 3b . These data were 14 Wechsler & Tinker measured independently for the present work. They represent the SMF at z= 0 based on data from SDSS DR7 (Abazajian et al. 2009) using the stellar masses of Chen et al. (2012). Other curves show models that have pushed the pivot point too high and too low. These models clearly fail to reproduce the abun

These models clearly fail to reproduce the abundance of galaxies: moving the pivot point too low yields too many low-mass galaxies and fails to produce any at the high mass end, while a pivot point too high has the opposite eect. The lled circles on each SHMR curve show the halo mass scale at which the galaxy mass is M= 1011M, on average. In all of these models, we have set the log-normal scatter in log Mat xedMhto be 0.2 dex. Modifying the power-law slopes of the SHMR will have a simil

The general shape and amplitude of the t produced in Figure 3 echoes the compilation of results shown in Figure 2 |a pivot point at Mh1012M, a steep slope at lower masses and a shallower slope at higher masses. We note that at low masses (stellar masses below 109M), there is evidence of a break in the SMF power law to produce more galaxies than a

Two-point galaxy clustering Because the abundance of dark matter halos is connected to their clustering properties, a given abundance matching or parameterized SHMR model makes a prediction for the clustering of galaxies. Once the parameters of the model have been set|the scatter, the abundance matching variable|there is no more freedom in the model after tting for
e is no more freedom in the model after tting for the galaxy abundance. The bottom panels of Figure 3 show the predictions each of the SHMR models make for the mean occupation function and clustering of galaxies with M1011 M. The lled circles in the bottom left correspond to the same Mhas the lled circle in the top left panel. Although these are non-parametric estimates of the HOD, the shapes are well-matched by the functional forms for central and satellite galaxies discussed earlier. Inc
tral and satellite galaxies discussed earlier. Increasing or decreasing the halo mass scale at M= 1011Mincreases and decreases the overall mass scale of the HOD. This has the impact of increasing and decreasing the clustering of galaxies. For HOD and CLF models, abundances alone cannot constrain the parameters of the models. This is because the number of satellites within a halo is a parameterized function, rather than mapped onto the substructure in a simulation. Thus, measurements that pro- 
ure in a simulation. Thus, measurements that pro- vide information about the halo mass are necessary to constrain the parameters of the HOD and CLF. Galaxy clustering is perhaps the most commonly used; galaxy clustering at r<1 Mpc is highly sensitive to the fraction of galaxies that are satellites because the number of pairs within a halo increases with the square of the number of satellites. Clustering at larger scales is most sensitive to the overall halo mass scale and the scatter between hal
verall halo mass scale and the scatter between halo mass and the observable quantity by which galaxies are selected. The halo occupation framework predicts a transition scale in the clustering of galaxies at r1 Mpc. This transition scale naturally explains the deviations from a power-law measured in the clustering of galaxies (Zehavi et al. 2004, 2005), as well as its evolution as a function of galaxy luminosity and redshift (Conroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov 2006). A convenient way to quantify large
Kravtsov 2006). A convenient way to quantify large-scale clustering of a sample of objects is by their bias relative to dark matter. Bias generically is related to the ratio between the clustering of the objects and that of the dark matter: b2==m, whereis the two-point correlation function of galaxies and the subscript m denotes matter. Bias is usually quantied at large scales, i.e., r>10 Mpc. The bias of dark www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 15 matter halos has a non-linear
y{Halo Connection 15 matter halos has a non-linear dependence on Mh|low mass halos have a roughly constant bias, while at higher masses bias rises rapidly with increasing Mh. Thus, for the three dierent models presented in Figure 3 , the bias of the model increases monotonically with the characteristic halo mass indicated by the lled circles. This does not mean that clustering has no information to oer for abundance-matching models. As we discuss in x4, models with dierent assumptions regard
uss in x4, models with dierent assumptions regarding how galaxies are matched to halos can change the relative rank-ordering of halos and subhalos, thus shifting the relative populations of central and satellite galaxies. Scatter can also not be constrained by abundances alone. The only way to discriminate between these models is to bring in information other than galaxy abundances, from clustering or one or more of the other observables described below (see further discussion in x4.3). 3.3. Gr
ed below (see further discussion in x4.3). 3.3. Group and cluster catalogs An alternative method to constrain the galaxy{halo connection is to nd individual dark matter halos observationally and measure the galaxy content within them. Galaxy clusters are relatively easy to nd in observational data owing to their large mass and the large number of galaxies contained within them. Figure 2 includes measurements of the SHMR at the cluster mass scale from Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov (2018) 
e from Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov (2018) using X-ray observations to detect clusters and Hansen et al. (2005) using optical imaging data. Optical cluster catalogs can now also be extended to very large volumes and to signicantly higher redshift, for example using red sequence techniques like RedMaPPer (Ryko et al. 2014, 2016); given the statistical power of these data sets, the primary challenge in using these to infer the galaxy{halo connection is a full modeling of systematics in th
connection is a full modeling of systematics in the mass{observable relation. Modern day galaxy group catalogs are able to probe much lower halo mass scales. The group-nding algorithm of Yang et al. (2005) uses a variation of the abundance matching ansatz to assign dark matter halo masses statistically to all galaxies within a given sample. After an initial guess about which galaxies belong to groups and which do not, abundance matching is performed on the total group stellar mass and the host 
rmed on the total group stellar mass and the host dark matter halo mass function. Each galaxy is assigned a probability of being within a given dark matter halo, using these updated halo masses, and the process is iterated until convergence. The result- ing halo occupation statistics that are derived from the nal group catalog are in general agreement with those inferred from an HOD analysis of clustering (Yang, Mo & van den Bosch 2008; Tinker, Wetzel & Conroy 2011; Campbell et al. 2015). The a
Wetzel & Conroy 2011; Campbell et al. 2015). The application of this algorithm to SDSS data in Yang, Mo & van den Bosch (2009) is also presented in Figure 2. Groups can also be used in combination with two-point clustering (Sinha et al. 2017). 3.4. Weak gravitational lensing It is straightforward to extend implementations of the galaxy{halo connection from models of the two-point clustering of galaxies to the cross-correlation between galaxies and matter (e.g. Tasitsiomi et al. 2004; Yoo et al. 
d matter (e.g. Tasitsiomi et al. 2004; Yoo et al. 2006; Cacciato et al. 2009; Leauthaud et al. 2012). Generally, the observational quantity being modeled is ( Rp), the excess surface mass density at a projected distance Rpaway from a galaxy, which is related to the galaxy-mass correlation function gm. If all galaxies were central, then ( Rp) would simply be a measure of the projected dark matter halo proles of all the galaxies in the sample being modeled. Satellite galaxies complicate the 
 being modeled. Satellite galaxies complicate the interpretation of the lensing signal, requiring a 16 Wechsler & Tinker full model of the galaxy{halo connection. Lensing generally has lower signal-to-noise than two-point clustering, but the constraints oered by a lensing analysis are complementary to that of an analysis only using clustering. Lensing directly measures the mass of the dark matter halos around galaxies, whereas in a clustering analysis the masses are inferred indirectly from the
alysis the masses are inferred indirectly from the relationship between halo mass and clustering, as well as the constraints on the abundance of halos in a given cosmological model. As we discuss in x4.4, properties other than halo mass may inuence clustering. Thus, a cross comparison of constraints on halo occupation from clustering and lensing is a necessary check on possible systematic errors or secondary parameters compared to using clustering alone. 3.5. Additional observables Although the
ng alone. 3.5. Additional observables Although the abundance of galaxies and their two-point clustering are the methods that have been most commonly used to statistically constrain the galaxy{halo connection, there is information on this relationship from nearly any measure of the spatial distribution of galaxies. Within the literature, these include satellite kinematics (van den Bosch et al. 2004; More et al. 2011), galaxy voids (Sheth & van de Weygaert 2004; Furlanetto & Piran 2006; Tinker et 
Weygaert 2004; Furlanetto & Piran 2006; Tinker et al. 2008a), counts-in-cells (Benson et al. 2000; Berrier et al. 2011), and three-point statistics (Mar n et al. 2008; Guo et al. 2015). Measurements of the intracluster light around clusters and groups of galaxies can also provide important constraints that distinguish the merging and growth history of galaxies (Conroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov 2007). Scaling relations of the internal properties of galaxies, such as Tully-Fisher and Faber- Jackson (
alaxies, such as Tully-Fisher and Faber- Jackson (Tully & Fisher 1977; Faber & Jackson 1976), also oer information to the extent that dark matter inuences the dynamics of visible matter (Dutton et al. 2010; Cappellari et al. 2013; Desmond & Wechsler 2015, 2017). At low masses, where large samples with observable spatial statistics are not yet available, these scaling relations provide the primary information about the galaxy{halo connection (McConnachie 2012). Strong lensing can provide additi
Connachie 2012). Strong lensing can provide additional information about the masses of elliptical galaxies, at least in their inner regions (Sonnenfeld et al. 2015). 4. BEYOND THE SIMPLEST MODELS OF THE GALAXY{HALO CONNECTION The simplest versions of the empirical models we outlined in x2, which connect one primary galaxy property to one halo property, describe the basic relations very well. However, they have now been shown in the literature to be inadequate for describing both the spatial dis-
be inadequate for describing both the spatial dis- tribution of galaxies at the precision it can now be measured and the full richness of galaxy properties and correlations that are observable. Here, we discuss additional modeling as- pects that may be required. We rst discuss the question of which halo property should be primary (x4.1). We then consider the question of alternative primary galaxy proper- ties (x4.2). We then review other aspects of the galaxy{halo connection that can impact clu
 of the galaxy{halo connection that can impact clustering properties, even for a given SHMR: scatter between galaxy mass and halo mass (x4.3), assembly bias ( x4.4), and the ratio of galaxy mass to halo mass between centrals and satellites (or, equivalently, the satellite fraction as a function of stellar mass; x4.5). We then discuss properties of the satellite distribution ( x4.6), and consider approaches to joint modeling of additional galaxy properties, including galaxy star formation rates, 
roperties, including galaxy star formation rates, galaxy www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 17 sizes, and gas properties. 4.1. What halo property is best matched to galaxies? The existence of a galaxy{halo connection does not specify which galaxy property correlates with which halo property, though mass is a typical assumption for both. Mapping galaxy stellar mass to dierent halo properties will yield the same SMF, but dierent clustering signals. Kravtsov et al. (2004) originall
ustering signals. Kravtsov et al. (2004) originally proposed using the maximum circular velocity of halosVmax|both parent halos and subhalos|to match onto galaxies. Whereas the mass of a subhalo is subject to intense tidal stripping immediately upon entering a larger halo, Vmaxis more robust to stripping. A solution to the tidal stripping problem that allows one to useMhis to useMhat the time the subhalo was accreted in order to match to galaxy properties. These ideas can be combined in various 
roperties. These ideas can be combined in various ways, all of which yield slightly dierent results in terms of the spatial distribution of galaxies.

Through most of this review, we consider galaxy stellar mass to be the primary galaxy property that is most tightly correlated with the properties of the galaxy halos. However, it is interesting to consider other possibilities. In the literature, galaxy stellar mass and galaxy luminosity have been treated rather interchangeably. It is likely that observational uncertainties in meas
is likely that observational uncertainties in measuring galaxy masses and luminosities may be larger than the dierence in the scatter between them, but with higher precision measurements it may be possible to make this distinction. The total stellar mass or luminosity in groups and clusters of galaxies is better correlated with halo mass than is the stellar mass or luminosity of the central galaxy; the former scales roughly as M;totM2=3 hon the massive end, whereas the latter scales roughly a
e massive end, whereas the latter scales roughly as M;cenM1=3 hon the massive end (e.g. Lin & Mohr 2004). Most of this review assumes that stars in galaxies are setting the primary property, instead of gas. This is largely due to the fact that obtaining large complete samples of galaxies with consistently measured gas properties is very challenging. A rst basic question is whether the correlation between halo mass and total baryon mass is stronger than the correlation with stellar mass. This 
nger than the correlation with stellar mass. This has been studied extensively with the Tully-Fisher relationship (e.g., McGaugh et al. 2000), and also with clustering of HI-selected samples (e.g., Guo et al. 2017). At the current level of accuracy, the scatter between stellar mass{ halo mass and baryon mass{halo mass appear to be comparable, although this may be more likely to break down for smaller mass galaxies which have high gas fractions (Bradford, Geha & Blanton 2015).

Future large HI surveys should allow a more comprehensive study of this question. www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 19 An alternative galaxy property is galaxy size. Accurate statistical modeling is becoming especially interesting now that the relationship between galaxy sizes and stellar masses have been measured for larger samples in the local Universe (Cappellari et al. 2013) and over a wide range of epochs with HST (van der Wel et al. 2014). Des
 of epochs with HST (van der Wel et al. 2014). Despite the complexity of galaxy formation, the tight scaling relations observed between various galaxy structural parameters imply a fairly tight connection between galaxy sizes and the properties of their dark matter halos. We discuss joint modeling of two galaxy properties further in x4.7.

These solid curves all show the SHMR as the mean value of Min bins ofMh. The dashed curves show the corresponding reverse relationship, the mean value of Mhin bins ofM. AslogMincreases, the mean halo mass at xed Mdecreases, even though the mean Mat xed Mhdecreases with increasing logM. 4.3. Scatter One of the principle questions about the galaxy{ha
One of the principle questions about the galaxy{halo connection is how much scatter there is between the properties of galaxies at a given halo mass. When comparing models, we consider scatter in the SHMR of central galaxies, e.g. the scatter in Mat xedMh, which we refer to as logM. In abundance matching models the actual parameterization is in terms of the matching proxy (see the sidebar titled Dierent Halo Properties for Abundance Matching), and this scatter is generally assumed to be log
), and this scatter is generally assumed to be lognormal and constant across all halo masses. This is both for convenience and because these assumptions appear to be consistent with all present data, including the results for tting HOD models to galaxy threshold samples. See, for example, Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler (2010) for the methodology of incorporating scatter in abundance matching while preserving the same stellar mass function. HOD models parameterize the mean number of galaxies per ha
ls parameterize the mean number of galaxies per halo. For HOD models of 20 Wechsler & Tinker luminosity or stellar mass threshold samples, the scatter is incorporated in the shape of the central galaxy occupation function. For central galaxies, because there can only be one or zero centrals, this translates to the probability of having a galaxy above the threshold as a function of halo mass. Thus the scatter derived in HOD models of this type is related to (but not exactly ) the scatter in halo 
related to (but not exactly ) the scatter in halo mass at a xed galaxy mass (or luminosity). The HOD analysis of SDSS galaxies by Zehavi et al. (2011) found that this scatter|the scatter inMhat xedLgal|monotonically rises with increasing Lgal. Figure 5 (left panel) shows the full two-dimensional distribution of halo masses and galaxy masses for the ducial model that matches the stellar mass function and clustering of SDSS galaxies presented in Figure 3 .

Above the pivot point the mean relation between MandMh is shallower, and galaxies across a xed width in log Mare spread out over a wider range of logMh. In abundance matching models, various choices for logMcan yield the same stellar mass function, but they do not predict the same spatial distribution of galaxies. The right- hand 
spatial distribution of galaxies. The right- hand panel of Figure 5 shows three dierent SHMRs, all three of which provide good ts to the same SDSS stellar mass function but have three dierent values of logM. The solid curves show each SHMR as the mean Mas a function of Mh. AslogMincreases, the solid curves decrease at xed Mh. In other words, the halo mass that yields a mean galaxy mass ofhMi= 1011:5Mincreases with logM. But recall that each model produces the same abundance of galax
at each model produces the same abundance of galaxies. Higher mass halos are less abundant, but the larger scatter brings in more low-mass halos that contain 1011:5Mgalaxies to preserve the same abundance. This has a direct impact on the clustering of galaxies, as higher mass halos above Mh>1012Mbecome increasingly more clustered (more highly biased). Thus the highest sensitivity to logMfrom clustering measurements is in samples of galaxies at high masses or luminosities. 4.4. Assembly bias 
t high masses or luminosities. 4.4. Assembly bias Halos and galaxies experience a wide variety of assembly histories, even at xed masses. Dierent assembly histories can inuence the secondary properties of halos and galaxies. Assembly history also correlates with large-scale environment, yielding a correlation between some secondary properties and the spatial distribution of objects. In this subsection, we review how this assembly bias manifests for halos, and how this might propagate into the
s for halos, and how this might propagate into the galaxy population. 4.4.1. Halo assembly bias. Halo assembly bias refers to the eect that the clustering of halos at xed mass has a dependence on properties other than Mh. This dependence was initially detected when sorting halos at a given mass by formation time, concentration, and spin (Wechsler 2001; Gao, Springel & White 2005; Wechsler et al. 2006), as well as for simulated galaxy samples (Croton, Gao & White 2007), and has now been studied
roton, Gao & White 2007), and has now been studied extensively in the literature for a number of properties of dark matter halos (see, e.g., Mao, Zentner & Wechsler 2018 for a recent comprehensive study). Figure 6 shows an example of halo assembly bias that can be seen visually in the distribution of low-mass halos, as well as a quantitative assessment. Dierent assembly bias eects can be created from tidal forces in the density eld (Hahn et al. (2009)), and from the statistics of peaks in a G
. (2009)), and from the statistics of peaks in a Gaussian www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 21 Figure 6: Halo assembly bias, manifesting in concentration, halo formation time, and halo angular momentum. Left Panel: The gray scale shows the distribution of dark matter in a 90x90x30 Mpc slice of a cosmological simulation at z= 0.

(2008)). Although its existence for dark matter halos is now well established, there are many open questions about the assembly bias signal for vario
questions about the assembly bias signal for various halo properties and whether or to what extent this eect propagates into the clustering of galaxies. We summarize some of these properties in the sidebar titled What Halo Properties Show Secondary Bias?, but note that in general, the secondary bias of various halo properties can be complex, and can have dierent mass and redshift dependence (Salcedo et al. 2018). Furthermore, Mao, Zent- ner & Wechsler (2018) have shown that even properties tha
echsler (2018) have shown that even properties that are highly correlated do not necessarily have the same clustering signal. This may make rst principles predictions for the expected galaxy assembly bias challenging, but it also indicates that precision measure- ments of galaxy clustering may provide insights into complex details of structure formation and the dependence of galaxy properties on halo properties.Halo concentration: Halo concentration is dened as cRhalo=rs, where rsis the scale

In the abundance matching paradigm, the relation between galaxies and halos is set by the halo property that is used to match to the given galaxy property. However, there is no a priori reason to limit the model to a single halo property. In the literature, there have been multiple models for multi-parameter galaxy{halo connecti
le models for multi-parameter galaxy{halo connections. Here we list two that vary the galaxy clustering properties for luminosity or mass selected galaxy samples; models that include assembly bias for secondary properties like color or star formation rate are discussed in x4.7. Composite abundance matching: In this model, the abundance matching parameter is a combination of two or more halo properties. In the model by Lehmann et al.

may depend on secondary halo properties that themselves show a halo assembly bias signature. This includes both central and satellite galaxies. Note that this denition, proposed by Zentner, Hearin & van den Bosch (2014) is not exactly parallel with the denition of halo assembly bias denition, and is dependent on the existence of halo assembly bias. It is well known that galaxy clustering depends on secondary galaxy properties, but this can be caused by dierent satellite fractions or a depend
caused by dierent satellite fractions or a dependence on halo mass for the secondary property. What halo properties show secondary bias?. Halo properties that show stronger assembly bias at lower masses: half-mass redshift zM=2, formation redshift ac, fractional halo growth rate  M=M . These quantities are usually dened with respect to Mhatz= 0, but they show assembly bias when dened at any redshift. Halo properties that show stronger assembly bias at higher masses: angular momen- tum, am
bly bias at higher masses: angular momen- tum, amount of substructure. Halo concentration shows signals at high and low masses, but the sign of the signal switches at the non-linear halo mass MMNL. the abundance matching parameter is v=vvirvmax vvir ; (1) wherevvir= (GM vir=Rvir)1=2is the virial velocity of the halo, and vmaxis the maximum circular velocity within the halo, and is a free parameter.

When = 1, the abundance matching parameter is vmax, which is directly related to halo concentration. This process is implemented on halo cata- logs that resolve substructure. In Lehmann et al. (2017) these halo quantities are evaluated at the epoch of peak halo mass. Increasing , therefore, has the eect of increasing the clustering at xed M(because of the eect of concentration on cl

This freedom essentially parameterizes our current ignorance about how much galaxy properties depend on concentration or formation time at a given halo mass, which impacts both the assembly bias and the satellite fraction at a given stellar mass.Non-linear halo mass, (MNL):This is dened as the mass at which the rms matter uctuations on the Lagrangian scale of the halo are equal to crit= 1:686 in linear theory.

Modied halo occupation models: The previous approach requires simulations that resolve substructure. An alternative is to take parameterized HOD models|i.e., models www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 23 in which the mean occupation function of central and satellite galaxies are parameterized as a function of Mh|and modify them to include addition

These models require cosmological simulations or a multi-parameter emulator based on such simulations, but no longer require that substructure be tracked. Hearin et al. (2016) proposed decorated HODs , with the secondary parameter being halo concentration; Tinker et al. (2008a) used large-scale density as the secondary parameter to make models to compare to measurements of clustering and voids. 
 compare to measurements of clustering and voids. In the decorated HOD models, the mean occupation function is increased or decreased, relative to the mean at a given value of Mh, on the basis of whether the concentration is above or below the median c. The change in the HOD can be either a step function or a smooth function in c, and can be either increasing with cor decreasing with c. Concentration is also fungible with other halo properties, but estimating cfor a halo has the advantage that i
ut estimating cfor a halo has the advantage that it does not require full halo merger trees, as zM=2,ac, and various other properties do. Given the strong correlation betweencand halo growth quantities|at least at mass scales below the cluster scale|the results seemed likely to be similar; however, the work of Mao, Zentner & Wechsler (2018) urges caution in making these simplifying assumptions. 4.5. Centrals vs. Satellites One of the keys to creating a robust model of the spatial distribution of
ting a robust model of the spatial distribution of galaxies is getting the correct fraction of satellite galaxies as a function of galaxy mass. One of the strongest arguments in favor of the galaxy{halo connection as a model with physical underpinnings is that a simple abundance matching model generally reproduces the small-scale clustering as a function of galaxy luminosity or mass, as well as its redshift dependence. But, as Figure 4demonstrates, details of the relative treatment of central an
s, details of the relative treatment of central and satellite galaxies matter when compared to the high precision of galaxy clustering measurements now available at many epochs. It is not a requirement of abundance matching or SHMR models that they treat the galaxies within host halos and subhalos the same. Indeed, the M0;peakandV0;peakmodels in that gure explicitly separate the two. Even for models that are matched to halos in the same way for centrals and satellites, the details can change th
centrals and satellites, the details can change the stellar mass of centrals vs. satellites at a given halo mass; see for example the change as one varies in Fig. 5 of Lehmann et al. (2017). In the SHMR model of Leauthaud et al. (2011, 2012), this exibility is introduced explicitly by having the SHMR only apply to central galaxies, and having the number of satellites within a halo vary freely, independently of the number of subhalos in the halo. Alternatively, one can have two dierent SHMR fu
. Alternatively, one can have two dierent SHMR functions|one for centrals and one for satellites|as done in Watson & Conroy (2013). Although the details do matter to within the precision of SDSS-like clustering measurements, Watson & Conroy (2013) concluded that in such a framework, the preferred model was one in which the SHMR for centrals and satellites was nearly the same. 4.6. Occupation properties of satellite galaxies For models that can calculate clustering without populating a simulatio
alculate clustering without populating a simulation|and this includes HOD, CLF, and some parameterized SHMR models (Vale & Ostriker 2004; Leauthaud et al. 2011)|assumptions are nearly always made that should not be taken as gospel in this era of precision measurements from large galaxy redshift surveys. The rst assumption is that satellite galaxies are assumed to follow the NavarroFrenkWhite (NFW) density prole, 24 Wechsler & Tinker which may not be true at very small scales (Watson et al. 201
ot be true at very small scales (Watson et al. 2012). The second assumption is that the second moment of the probability distribution of satellite galaxy occupation has been assumed to be Poisson in most previous work. Models for the halo occupation distribution require an assumption about both the mean and moments of the occupation distribution. Higher order moments can have an impact on clustering properties and on cosmological systematics, so it is important to know how robust the simplifying
it is important to know how robust the simplifying assumption of a Poisson distribution is. The scatter in the number of subhalos at xed mass was shown to be super-Poissonian for small average occupation numbers (Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2010; Busha et al. 2011); Wu et al. (2013) showed that the scatter can in detail depend on how galaxies or subhalos are selected. Mao, Williamson & Wechsler (2015) showed that this can be explained by Poisson scatter at xed mass and formation history , combined w
er at xed mass and formation history , combined with dependence of the number of subhalos on other properties (e.g. formation history, environment, or concentration) at xed mass; Jiang & van den Bosch (2017) claimed that this is not quite true, and that the distribution is both sub-Poissonian at small average occupation number and super-Poissonian at large average occupation number. They present an accurate tting function for the distribution and show how this can impact clustering. 4.7. Join
and show how this can impact clustering. 4.7. Joint modeling of mass and secondary properties Thus far we have discussed the relationship between a single galaxy property (mass or lumi- nosity) and a single or composite halo property. Of course, the full galaxy{halo connection is more complicated, and for a full description of galaxy formation we will be interested in the full multivariate connection between galaxy and halo properties over time. Here we review approaches to modeling a secondary 
Here we review approaches to modeling a secondary property in addition to stellar mass or luminosity. Halo occupation methods can be extended to incorporate more than one galaxy prop- erty. For example, Skibba & Sheth (2009) developed an HOD model that incorporated galaxy color. Xu et al. (2018) recently created a conditional color-magnitude distribution, an extension of the CLF methodology. Both of these methods parameterize the mean occupation of galaxies within halos using Mhonly. A complemen
of galaxies within halos using Mhonly. A complementary way to incorporate secondary properties into the galaxy{halo con- nection is through `conditional abundance matching', as proposed by Hearin & Watson (2013). In this framework, halo mass is rst abundance matched to Mor luminosity, and then secondary galaxy properties are abundance matched to secondary halo properties in narrow bins of MorMh. This framework was explored and rened using galaxy color (Hearin & Watson 2013; Hearin et al. 201
axy color (Hearin & Watson 2013; Hearin et al. 2014) and star formation rate (Watson et al. 2015) as the secondary galaxy property. For the secondary halo property, variations on halo age and formation time were employed. At xed halo mass, the earliest forming halos con- tained galaxies with the reddest colors or lowest star formation rates, thus this model can be described as an `age-matching model.' However, this framework extends naturally to any secondary galaxy property or halo property. F
 any secondary galaxy property or halo property. For example, Tinker et al. (2017b) used conditional abundance matching to connect galaxy morphology to halo angular momentum at xedMh. Hearin et al. (2017) connected galaxy size to halo virial radius at the time of Mpeakthrough a related approach (we discuss constraints on galaxy sizes in x6.4).

If the secondary halo property used exhibits an assembly bias signal (such as age, concentration, or spin), then this would manifest as a clustering www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 25 dependence in the secondary galaxy property. Several recent studies have begun to explore the evolution of gas in galaxies in more detail in both hydrodynamical simulations (Power, Baugh & Lacey 2010; Bah e & McCarthy 2015; Lagos et al. 2014) and semi-analytic models (Popping, Some
 al. 2014) and semi-analytic models (Popping, Somerville & Trager 2014; Lu et al. 2014). Empirical models for full galaxy populations are starting to be used to model gas as well. Recently, Popping, Behroozi & Peeples (2015) used an empirical model for the star formation histories along with observed scaling relationships between stellar and gas densities to develop a model which traces the evolution of gas properties over time. We expect modeling the gas{halo connection to be an area of extensi

The mean stellar-to-halo mass relation for central galaxies Figure 2 presented the constraints on the SHMR in the local universe, painting a consistent picture of the relationship between halos and total galaxy mass from a variety of methods and datasets. These approaches have now been described in the preceding sections. There is remarkable c

There is remarkable consistency on the general outlines of the SHMR from these methods, includ- ing constraints from non-parametric abundance matching (Behroozi, Conroy & Wechsler 2010; Reddick et al. 2013; Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy 2013a), the parameterized SHMR inferred from abundance matching (Guo et al. 2010; Moster, Naab & White 2013, 2018), the halo occupation distribution (Zheng, Coil & Zehavi 2007), the conditional luminosity function (Yang et al. 2012), ab
itional luminosity function (Yang et al. 2012), abundance matching from X-ray clusters (Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov 2018), or models based on evolving galaxies within their dark matter halo histories constrained by galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing (Behroozi et al. 2018). These approaches use dierent observables and dierent modeling techniques. For ex- ample, the HOD and CLF leave satellite occupation as a free parameter to be constrained by the data, whereas abundance matchi

Scatter for central galaxies One of the most important aspects of the galaxy{halo connection is the scatter in central galaxy stellar mass at xed halo mass, logM. It is not possible to constrain logMfrom the abundance of galaxies alone; here we present a number of possibilities that can constrain this parameter: galaxy clustering, galaxy groups and clusters, satellite kinematics, galaxy{ galaxy lensing, and
 satellite kinematics, galaxy{ galaxy lensing, and galaxy scaling relations. Galaxy clustering: Halo bias is a strong function of mass for halos above MNL, so in this regime galaxy clustering can provide a strong constraint on scatter. The left panel ofFigure 7 gives an example, based on galaxy clustering at z0:5 from the BOSS survey (Tinker et al. 2017a). Dierent curves represent the predictions of SHMR models with dierent scatter values, but only logM= 0:18 provides a good t to the obser
 only logM= 0:18 provides a good t to the observed bias of BOSS galaxies. The constraining power of clustering is primarily at the massive end; this result is best characterized as a constraint in logMin the halo mass range of logMh= [12:7;13:7]. Using a combination of galaxy clustering and galaxy lensing of z= 0 SDSS galaxies, an independent study by Zu & Mandelbaum (2015) obtained a constraint on the scatter at Mh= 1012M(logM= 0:22+0:02  0:01) and atMh= 1014M (logM= 0:180:01).

Galaxy groups and clusters: Galaxy groups and clusters can constrain the scatter www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 27 by directly measuring the properties of central galaxies in groups of clusters of a given mass. Using a sample of galaxy clusters with well-measured X-ray halo mass estimates, Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov (2018) derived a value of logM= 0:17 by directly measuring the scatter around the mean M-Mhrelation. This

Similar measurements can be made by galaxy group catalogs; here a critical issue is how well the mass of the group can be measured.

However, these data are consistent with a model in which logM= 0:2 or somewhat smaller, which is consistent with constraints from clustering, lensing, and group statistics. Scaling relations: Before the advent of surveys that could measure clustering and lensing for large galaxy samples, the observation of tight dynamical scaling relations was the best clue that galaxy and halo properties were tightly connected.

These have contin- ued to provide interesting constraints on galaxy formation models (Governato et al. 2007; Somerville et al. 2008); for example simultaneously matching clustering, abundance, and the Tully-Fisher relation has been challenging. Recently, studies have begun to combine these constraints to test empirical models (Desmond & Wechsler 2015, 2017). Although with current samples these are not yet competitive with clustering to constrain scatter in the primary galaxy parameter (stell

This is in good agreement with current predictions from hydrodynamical simulations, as well as with some of the empirical models.

This may be due to inadequate correlation between www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 29 when galaxies are quenched and the properties of halos at that time; it will be important to understand what dierences in the physical parameterizations lead to this dierence. Thus far we have discussed primarily the regime above the pivot point around M= 1012, where the scatter is well constrained by several observational measures. As seen in Figure 7 , at present, clustering, group catalogs
 Figure 7 , at present, clustering, group catalogs, and satellite kinematics only produce strong constraints above this regime, although the tightness of galaxy scaling relations provide some constraint at lower masses. At halo masses above 1012:5Mwhere the observational constraints are most robust, most models do predict roughly constant scatter. At lower masses, most models predict increasing scatter, though care must be taken with resolution eects (for example, if the merger histories are 
 eects (for example, if the merger histories are measured with low resolution, this may create articial scatter) and also with denitions | which scatter is being considered? When considering scatter at the lowest masses, down to the dwarf scale, we have very little direct observational information about the scatter of central galaxies, and many studies (both observational and theoretical) have so far considered primarily the scatter of satellites within the Milky Way or similar simulated gala
tes within the Milky Way or similar simulated galaxies. Here then, it is important to distinguish scatter due to satellite stripping from scatter due to the formation processes for central galaxies. For example Munshi et al. (2017) claim to nd high scatter in low mass galaxies, but in fact show rather small scatter, <0:25 dex, for the pre-stripped quantities. Overall, the evidence suggests that there is slightly more scatter in the stellar masses of dwarf galaxies; understanding how large this
es of dwarf galaxies; understanding how large this scatter is a critical piece of tests of the CDM model in this regime and will be a major area of future work as samples of dwarf galaxies increase (Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin 2017). 5.3. Evolution Above we have primarily focused on the galaxy{halo connection in the local universe, where it is accurately constrained by the abundance and detailed clustering properties of galaxies. How do we expect it to evolve? Stellar mass functions have been measu
 to evolve? Stellar mass functions have been measured up to z8, allowing abundance matching to be applied over the majority of the history of the universe. The rst study to investigate the evolution of the SHMR over most of cosmic time was performed by Conroy & Wechsler (2009) who used abundance matching at individual epochs combined with information about halo accretion over time to infer the evolution of the SHMR and galaxy assembly histories. This has since been extended by other authors us
. This has since been extended by other authors using halo merger trees directly, as well as extensive updated information on the populations of high redshift galaxies. The primary conclusion from a range of studies is that the star formation eciency, dened here as the ratio of the star formation rate divided by the mass accretion rate, is a strong function of mass, peaking at roughly 1012M, but a very weak function of redshift. This is shown in the left panel of Figure 9 , based on the resul
in the left panel of Figure 9 , based on the results of Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy (2013b), which synthesized a range of measurements. This study found that two-thirds of all star formation occurs in a relatively narrow range of halo masses. We note that the halo mass accretion rate is declining with time, so the star formation rate itself is signicantly higher for a galaxy at a given stellar mass at higher redshift. A typical galaxy that lives in a massive halo today started forming stars ear
 in a massive halo today started forming stars early, but then at relatively early times moved out of this ecient mass range. A typical galaxy in a smaller halo started forming stars later, but spends a longer region in this regime of ecient star formation. The resulting SHMR as inferred by the study of Behroozi et al. (2018) is shown in the right 30 Wechsler & Tinker 1 2 4 6 8 10 12 13.8 Time Since Big Bang [Gyr]109101010111012101310141015Halo Mass [MO•]84 2 1 0.5 0.2 0z No Halos Star Formati

Because low mass galaxies are still building up, their stellar mass to halo mass ratio increases over this time. Above z3, nearly all galaxies are still forming stars ecient
early all galaxies are still forming stars eciently, and it is unclear whether the SHMR turns over and declines at the highest masses. Galaxy clustering and galaxy lensing can be used to test these models out to higher redshift. This has been done using clustering alone in surveys like BOSS, DEEP, and PRIMUS out to z1 both for typical Lgalaxies (Zheng, Coil & Zehavi 2007; Coil et al. 2008; Abbas et al. 2010; Tinker & Wetzel 2010; Wake et al. 2011; Skibba et al. 2015) and for massive galaxies

Clustering and lensing were combined to constrain the SHMR in COSMOS out to z1 (Leauthaud et al. 2012). Lensing by itself can also provide constraints at higher redshift (Hudson et al. 2015), although these constraints can be signicantly tightened by bringing in measurements of clustering and/or the stellar mass function (van Uitert et al. 2016). We ex
llar mass function (van Uitert et al. 2016). We expect that the current and next generation of large imaging and spectroscopic surveys will dramatically increase the statistical power of these constraints to higher redshift. 5.4. How does assembly bias manifest observationally? In models of galaxy assembly bias, star formation eciency may depend on halo properties other than halo mass. The consequence of such a secondary correlation would be that the residuals of the SHMR would correlate with o
t the residuals of the SHMR would correlate with other halo properties. Observationally, this could impact the clustering of galaxies as a function of stellar mass. Such an eect has been searched for by a number of authors. Lehmann et al. (2017) and Zentner et al. (2016) have tz= 0 clustering measurements using models that include secondary halo properties. Lehmann et al. (2017) used the composite abundance matching method, whereas Zentner et al. (2016) used the enhanced HOD method. Both model
l. (2016) used the enhanced HOD method. Both models used halo concentration as their secondary halo property. Both found at least one luminosity threshold sample that preferred www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 31 a model in which galaxy occupation depended on cin such a way to increase the chance of nding a central galaxy in higher concentration halos, thus boosting the clustering of the model galaxies. This is in agreement with some results from both semi-analytic models and c
 some results from both semi-analytic models and cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, which we present in x6. A signicant caveat to both of these analyses is that they are performed at a xed cos- mology. The amplitude of galaxy clustering for a xed HOD is sensitive to the amplitude of dark matter uctuations, which can be inuenced by 8,  m, and to a lesser extent other cosmological parameters. Thus it is an open question whether galaxy assembly bias is required to match the observed level
embly bias is required to match the observed level of galaxy clustering over the entire range of cos- mological parameter space currently allowed by cosmic microwave background and other large-scale structure probes. Alternatively, if one's goal is to constrain cosmology from analysis of non-linear clustering, galaxy assembly bias can be degenerate with changes in cosmological parameters. Thus, robust analyses of small-scale galaxy clustering must take galaxy assembly bias into account in order 
t take galaxy assembly bias into account in order to yield robust cosmological constraints. 5.5. Systematic uncertainties As the statistical power of the data constraining the galaxy{halo connection increases, it is important to consider the impact of both observational and theoretical systematic errors on these constraints. Here we mention a few of the most important of each. 5.5.1. Observational systematics. It is worth noting that denitions and measurement un- certainties can matter both qua
nd measurement un- certainties can matter both qualitatively and quantitatively. A particularly important sys- tematic error is the fact that in large imaging surveys, the surveys have surface brightness limits and imperfect pipelines that can lead to mis-estimates of the total mass of a galaxy. For some time, most of the low redshift estimates of the SHMR were based on stellar mass and clustering estimates of SDSS data. These studies may have underestimated the stellar mass/luminosity of bright
derestimated the stellar mass/luminosity of brightest cluster galaxies by factors of several at the massive end (Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov 2018; Bernardi et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). There are several related issues that can impact this estimation. Dierences in the estima- tion of sky subtraction dominate, but modeling the outer proles of galaxies, distinguishing between central galaxies and the intracluster light (Conroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov 2007), and the estimation of stellar 
r & Kravtsov 2007), and the estimation of stellar masses themselves can also contribute. The high mass end of the SHMR has important consequences for inferences about cooling rates and feedback in massive galaxies, and studies that were based on these earlier results should be re-evaluated in this light. In particular, based on more recent estimates that indicate increased mass estimates of massive galaxies, group and cluster mass halos should be expected to host larger central galaxies than ear
 expected to host larger central galaxies than earlier estimates would have indicated, for example scaling as MM0:4 h; this can be seen in the estimate of the SHMR in Figure 2 from Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov (2018) and Behroozi et al. (2018) compared to previous es- timates. An additional uncertainty is due to possible changes in the stellar initial mass function at high mass and as a function of radius within a galaxy (Bernardi et al. 2017; Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov 2018). 
 2017; Kravtsov, Vikhlinin & Meshcheryakov 2018). These systematics can impact the need for eective feedback at the massive end, so they are directly relevant to physical inference from the SMHR. 32 Wechsler & Tinker 5.5.2. Theoretical systematics. Although gravity is a well-understood process, the results of cosmological N-body simulations are still subject to systematic errors that can impact the predictions of models of the galaxy{halo connection. These errors fall into two main categories: 
tion. These errors fall into two main categories: resolution and substructure disruption, and robustness of halo nding and track- ing. Lack of spatial and temporal resolution can limit the ability of a simulation to resolve substructure within halos, even with proper mass resolution (see, e.g., Moore, Lake & Katz 1998; Klypin et al. 1999; Ghigna et al. 2000). van den Bosch (2017) estimates that roughly 80 per cent of all subhalo disruption is numerical rather than physical, which may be due to 
merical rather than physical, which may be due to inadequate force softening in simulations (van den Bosch & Ogiya 2018; van den Bosch et al. 2018). Lack of subhalos equates to lack of satellite galaxies, which can cause models to compare poorly to clustering measurements, or alternatively can drive model selection to parameters that articially increase the number of satellites. To account for this, some studies incorporate `orphan' subhalos which algorithmically follow the estimated path of di
ch algorithmically follow the estimated path of disrupted substructure. In some semi-analytic models, the fraction of galaxies represented by orphans can be 10{30% (Pujol et al. 2017). To control for this in abundance matching, studies like that by Reddick et al. (2013) and Lehmann et al. (2017) have compared results from simulations with various resolutions to limit data comparisons to regions in which numerical results are converged, although caution is still warranted given these ndings on d
aution is still warranted given these ndings on disruption. Even if substructure is properly resolved in a simulation, identifying and tracking the substructure robustly can still be a challenge. Many theoretical models require knowledge of the full history of a given halo or subhalo to properly assign its galaxy. Commonly used algorithms such as Rockstar (Behroozi, Wechsler & Wu 2013) and Subfind (Springel et al. 2001) do not always yield the same results. Comparisons of dierent substructure-

(2012) and Muldrew, Pearce & Power (2011) nd generally consistent results, with caveats for when the number of particles in a subhalo becomes small (e.g. less than 50 particles) and when a subhalo passes through the center of a parent halo. In addition to just nding the subhalos, there is also the need to trace their merger histories. Srisawat et al. (2013) compared dierent merger tree codes, nding distinc
ompared dierent merger tree codes, nding distinct results from dierent codes run on the same simulation. That work proposes a list of necessary features that all codes should contain to produce robust results. 6. CURRENT CONSTRAINTS ON SECONDARY PROPERTIES IN THE GALAXY{HALO CONNECTION Models of the galaxy{halo connection that parameterize this relationship using Mhonly have been highly successful in modeling observational data. However, the question remains of just how far the mass-only appr
uestion remains of just how far the mass-only approach can go to represent the observed galaxy distribution when incorporating galaxy properties other than Mand luminosity. The main emphasis of this section is on models of galaxy bimodality: dividing the observed population into blue, star-forming objects and red-and-dead passively evolving galaxies. x6.1 reviews current constraints on the SHMR divided along these two lines, while x6.2 reviews the pursuit of observational signatures of galaxy a

All of these data are based on the SDSS galaxy sample, but they represent a myriad of analysis techniques, including satel- lite kinematics (More et al. 2011), empirical abundance modeling (Moster, Naab & White 2018), two-point clustering and abundances (Rodr guez-Puebla et al. 2015), a combination of weak lensing with clustering (Zu & Mandelbaum 2016), and the forward-modeling Uni- verse Machine of Behroozi et al.

These studies nd a range of results, including that the quantity Mred=Mbluecan be both above or below unity, with one study nding no dierence in the SHMR for the two sub-populations. Conditional abundance matching models of color make dierent predictions depending on the exact procedure and which halo properties are chosen to match to. Dierent models can predict, at xed Mh, tha
h to. Dierent models can predict, at xed Mh, that passive galaxies can be either more massive, less massive, or the same as star-forming galaxies. As a simple benchmark for interpretation and comparison to observations, the connected 34 Wechsler & Tinker open circles represent a passive quenching model . In this model, galaxies come o the star- forming sequence randomly and evolve passively, independently of their halo's growth|i.e., the galaxy within a fast-growing 1012Mhalo is just as like
y within a fast-growing 1012Mhalo is just as likely to quench as a slow-growing halo of the same mass. Between z= 1 andz= 0, the halos grow independently of the state of their central galaxies: the red-sequence galaxies have minimal stellar mass growth, whereas the star-forming galaxies continue to add to their stellar mass. Thus, even if SHMR red=SHMR blue= 1 atz= 1, byz= 0 they will be dierent. The red galaxies will be less massive than the blue galaxies at xed Mh. The predictions of this m

The indicated trend with mass is expected from the buildup of the red sequence; passive central galaxies at low Mhave only recently arrived on the red sequence, but massive galaxies quench at very early times, thus there is a large fraction of the age of the universe over which blue galaxies can build up substantially more mass than the quenched galaxies in the same halos. To yield a Mred=Mblueratio dierent 
same halos. To yield a Mred=Mblueratio dierent than the passive model, the assumption that galaxy quenching is uncorrelated with halo formation history must break down. Whether or not this breakdown yields galaxy assembly bias in galaxy bimodality|which we have dened as a spatial correlation of galaxy properties (other than mass) at xed Mh|is an open question we examine further in this section. Current constraints clearly deviate from the predictions of the passive model. However, given the
edictions of the passive model. However, given the lack of agreement between z= 0 studies, we conclude that the Mred=Mblueratio and its dependence on halo mass remains an open question. The dierences in these results may come from a myriad of sources. In each approach there are dierent modeling assumptions, and each uses dierent statistical quantities to constrain the SHMRs. Each uses dierent estimates of galaxy stellar mass. Moster, Naab & White (2018) and Behroozi et al. (2018) use star-
 White (2018) and Behroozi et al. (2018) use star-formation rate to classify galaxies, whereas the other studies use broadband colors, which can lead to heterogeneous samples. To create progress, each of these assumptions will have to be tested to understand the impact on the SHMR constraints. One question there is near-consensus on is: Does the SHMR for star-forming galaxies have a pivot point? This question is important because it has consequences for galaxy feedback and the source of the pivo
ces for galaxy feedback and the source of the pivot point in the overall SHMR|is the overall pivot point due to more massive galaxies being quenched, or do star-forming galaxies also undergo a transition at 1012M, above which star formation is less ecient even though they are actively star-forming? With the exception of the results from satellite kinematics, which have large error bars at high Mh, all of the analyses in Figure 10 nd that star-forming galaxies do indeed have a pivot point. The
forming galaxies do indeed have a pivot point. The preceding discussion has focused on central galaxies, but satellite galaxies are a major component of the quenched population. Analyses from groups and clusters nd that, at allM, satellites have a higher quenched fraction than centrals, and that at xed M, the quenched fraction of satellites monotonically increases with Mh(see, e.g., Yang, Mo & van den Bosch 2008; Peng et al. 2010; Wetzel, Tinker & Conroy 2012; Wetzel et al. 2013; Wang et al.
ker & Conroy 2012; Wetzel et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2018). The interpretation of this is that the quenching eciency of satellites is higher than that of central galaxies. Indeed, while there are quenched satellite galaxies at any value of M, Geha et al. (2012) found that below the limit of M109M, no isolated central galaxies are quenched. www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 35 6.2. How does assembly bias manifest observationally for secondary properties? If secondary galaxy pro

In this subsection we review results of observational signatures of galaxy assembly bias, focusing on galaxy quenching and galactic conformity. We further compare recent results to predictions from galaxy formation models. 6.2.1. Galaxy assembly bias and galaxy quenching. Most emphasis to date regar
 and galaxy quenching. Most emphasis to date regarding obser- vational signatures of galaxy assembly has focused on the galaxy bimodality and whether a galaxy is star-forming or quenched. We demonstrated in the preceding section that stud- ies of the SHMRs for star-forming and passive galaxies are inconclusive. Here we review searches for galaxy assembly bias by directly probing the spatial distribution of galaxies. There have been a number of investigations looking for assembly bias in the clus
vestigations looking for assembly bias in the clustering of red and blue galaxies using group catalogs to estimate halo mass, including Yang, Mo & van den Bosch (2006); Wang et al. (2008); Lacerna, Padilla & Stasyszyn (2014). We regard these results as too susceptible to biases from the group catalog to be reliable. Campbell et al. (2015) looked in detail at the results of state-of-the-art group nders and how they assign halo masses to galaxies separated by color. They found that halo masses ca
separated by color. They found that halo masses can be highly biased, possibly explaining diering results in the previous studies. Additionally, Lin et al. (2016) used weak lensing to determine unbiased halo mass estimates of galaxy groups|using the Yang, Mo & van den Bosch (2009) group catalog|split into red and blue central galaxies. Lin et al. (2016), focusing on groups at Mh1012M, found that groups labeled with the same halo mass from the group nder yield dierent lensing signals, indica
group nder yield dierent lensing signals, indicating larger halo masses in the groups with red central galaxies. Thus, using the halo masses assigned by the group nder could lead to a spurious detection of assembly bias by yielding a higher clustering amplitude for the groups with red centrals. In contrast, when using lensing measurements to create samples with the same Mh, the clustering of groups with red central galaxies was the same as the clustering of groups with blue central galaxies. 
 clustering of groups with blue central galaxies. 6.2.2. Galactic Conformity. Galactic conformity is the phenomenon that the properties of neighboring galaxies are correlated with|i.e., they `conform to'|the properties of nearby central galaxies. Conformity studies are usually focused on the color or star formation rates of galaxies. They are divided into two distinct, but possibly correlated, spatial regimes: When the neighboring galaxies of a given central are within the same dark matter halo,
iven central are within the same dark matter halo, this is called one-halo conformity. When the neighboring galaxies are outside the halo virial radius of the central galaxy, this is called two-halo conformity. Conformity can be quantied in a number of ways, but a straightforward test is to look at central galaxies of a given M, divided into star-forming and passive samples. The quenched fractions, fq, of neighbors is measured around each of the central subsamples. If fqfor the neighbors aroun
e central subsamples. If fqfor the neighbors around passive centrals is higher than fqfor the neighbors around star-forming centrals, this is a detection of conformity. The attention on galactic conformity is driven in part by the possible connection to halo and galaxy assembly bias. For the one-halo term, it is possible to posit quenching mechanisms for central galaxies that also impact the quenching eciency of satellites.

conformity need not be related to assembly bias. But if quenching of central galaxies is related to halo formation history, then it will also be related to the accretion history of satellites|i.e., old parent halos will have old central galaxies as well 36 Wechsler & Tinker 8Calderon et al.  0.3 0.2 0.10.00.10.20.3 fqlogssfrSDSSMocks 121314log (Mgroup) h 1M  05Res.

Moreover, it is necessary to use alarge suite of mock catalogues to properly specify the distri-bution of the null model. A few of our 100 mock cataloguesdo not display spurious conformity signals and so if we hadonly used one mock that happened to lack any conformitysignals, 
mock that happened to lack any conformitysignals, we would have come to the wrong conclusion aboutthe signiﬁcance of our conformity detection. Our result callsinto question previous claims of 1-halo conformity detec-tions, especially from papers that used similar group-basedmethods as ours, including the original detection byW06.3.1.2M(rp)for 1-halo ConformityWe now move to the second statistic that we are using toprobe galactic conformity, the“marked correlation function”,M(rp). Since theM(rp)c
arked correlation function”,M(rp). Since theM(rp)can be more sensitive than binarystatistics, and can potentially uncover the scale dependenceof any correlations (see discussion in§2.5), theM(rp)iswell-suited to exploring the correlations between central andsatellite galaxies.We evaluateM(rp)for the three galaxy properties, i.e.(g r)colour, sSFR, and S´ ersic index, in di↵erent bins ofMgroup. Each galaxy pair is comprised of a central galaxyand a satellite galaxy of the same galaxy group, and th
 satellite galaxy of the same galaxy group, and the pro-jected distance,rp, is the distance between the two membergalaxies. We then take the product of the ‘marks’ of the twogalaxies and average this over all pairs in bins ofrp. Themark for each galaxy is just the value of its property (e.g.,colour) normalised by the mean value over the whole popu-lation of similar galaxies. We do this in two ways. First, wenormalise using the mean of all central or satellite galaxiesin the same bin ofMgroup. Fo
 or satellite galaxiesin the same bin ofMgroup. For example, the colour of eachcentral (satellite) galaxy is divided by the mean colour of allcentral (satellite) galaxies that live in similar mass groups.M(rp)then measures the correlation coe cient between thenormalised colours of central and satellite galaxies. Sincethis measurement is done inrpbins, it is sensitive to ra-dial gradients in the properties of satellite galaxies withingroups, typically referred to assegregation. For example, ifgro
ally referred to assegregation. For example, ifgroups contain colour segregation in the sense that satellitegalaxies in the central regions of groups tend to be redderthan satellite galaxies in the outskirts of groups, thenM(rp)will be larger than unity in bins of smallrpand less thanunity in bins of largerp. Such a radial segregation e↵ectwill masquerade as a 1-halo conformity signal. To accountfor this, we do a second normalization where the propertiesof satellite galaxies are normalised by th
opertiesof satellite galaxies are normalised by the mean values ofall satellites that live in the same bin of bothMgroupandrp. Measured in this way,M(rp)is not sensitive to radialsegregation and so values di↵erent from unity are direct in-dications of conformity.To assess the statistical signiﬁcance of a conformity sig-nal, we use the same shu✏ing technique described in§3.1.1.Randomly shu✏ing the marks of galaxies erases any correla-tions that are present between central and satellite galaxieswi
e present between central and satellite galaxieswithin each bin ofMgroup. As a result, the measuredM(rp)contains no real signal by construction and any values thatdi↵er from unity must be due to noise. We perform the shuf-ﬂing 1000 times and conﬁrm that distribution of shu✏edvaluesM(rp)shu✏eis consistent with being Gaussian, so weuse their standard deviation to calculate the1 ,2 , and3 ranges.

Additionally, Hearin, Watson & van den Bosch (2015) proposed two-halo galactic conformity as a sensitive test of galaxy assembly bias. The formation histories of neighboring halos are correlated. Thus, if these formation histories are correlated with quenching mechanisms, two-halo conformity will be present. It is possible to have one-halo conformity without the presence of two-halo conf
o conformity without the presence of two-halo conformity, but two-halo conformity by itself necessarily produces a one-halo eect: the satellites in the z= 0 universe were themselves once neighbors in the eld before being accreted. The rst detection of conformity was presented by Weinmann et al. (2006), looking at satellites (the neighbors) around central galaxies in the 1-halo regime using a galaxy group catalog from z= 0 SDSS data. They found that, at xed halo mass, the fqof satellite galax
 that, at xed halo mass, the fqof satellite galaxies was higher when the central was quenched itself, with  fq0:1{0.2 between passive and star-forming central galaxies. Other analyses have found similar results (e.g., Knobel et al. 2015; Kawinwanichakij et al. 2016; Berti et al. 2017). However, subsequent studies have examined possible systematic biases in the use of the group catalogs to identify halos. Campbell et al. (2015) demonstrated that errors in the estimated halo masses can create a
t errors in the estimated halo masses can create a false 1-halo conformity signal. Calderon, Berlind & Sinha (2017) showed that the www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 37 1-halo fqfound in SDSS data was consistent with this false signal, which is shown in left panel of Figure 11 . These tests assessing the impact of observational biases do not take into account the possibility that quenched central galaxies live in more massive halos at xedM, which would also induce a 1-halo con
os at xedM, which would also induce a 1-halo conformity signal with no galaxy assembly bias, as found in the semi-analytic galaxy model of Wang & White (2012). The rst detection of two-halo conformity was presented by Kaumann et al. (2013). Their approach to conformity was to identify central galaxies through an isolation criterion, then rank order the central galaxies by their specic star formation rates (sSFRs) and calculated the median sSFR of neighbor galaxies for each quartile in the c
FR of neighbor galaxies for each quartile in the central sSFR. The measurements showed a substantial decrease in the sSFR of neighbor galaxies around the lowest star-forming central galaxies out to 4 Mpc. However, further studies by Tinker et al. (2018) and Sin, Lilly & Henriques (2017) have shown this eect to be primarily a selection bias in the isolation criterion. The right-hand panel in Figure 11 compares the original Kaumann et al. (2013) result to a new analysis when the small fraction o
result to a new analysis when the small fraction of satellite galaxies are removed from the original sample of `isolated' galaxies. Other studies using quenched fractions (Berti et al. 2017) and marked correlation func- tions (Calderon, Berlind & Sinha 2017) have found statistically signicant two-halo signals, but are small in their actual amplitude, implying  fq1%. At this level, it is not clear if the conformity signals found indicates galaxy assembly bias or if they can be explained by var
y assembly bias or if they can be explained by various systematic issues (Tinker et al. 2018). Using the conditional abundance matching framework of Hearin & Watson (2013), Tinker et al. (2018) compared various implementa- tions of the age-matching model to measurements of two-halo conformity in SDSS galaxies. The low level of two-halo conformity measured in SDSS is inconsistent with a model in which galaxy quenching correlates strongly with halo formation time or similar secondary halo properti
 formation time or similar secondary halo properties. Current data cannot rule out any correlation between these two quantities az= 0, but the correlation can only be weak at best. Similar conclusions were reached by Zu & Mandelbaum (2016), Zu & Mandelbaum (2018), and Tinker et al. (2017c). 6.2.3. Comparison with physical models. Results from the EAGLE hydrodynamic simula- tion (Matthee et al. 2017) and semi-analytic models (Croton, Gao & White 2007; Tojeiro et al. 2017) both show a clear correl
007; Tojeiro et al. 2017) both show a clear correlation of halo age with total stellar mass of the central galaxy. At xed Mh, early-forming halos form more massive galaxies, whereas later-forming halos form less massive ones. This theoretical prediction is in agreement with Zentner et al. (2016) and Lehmann et al. (2017), both of which claimed to detect galaxy assembly bias in the total stellar mass of galaxies (under the assumption that more massive galaxies are brighter, which is true for sta
ssive galaxies are brighter, which is true for star-forming galaxies but less clear for a mixture of active and passively evolving galaxies). Analyzing star-forming central galaxies (i.e., removing all passive galaxies from the sam- ple) from an SDSS group catalog, Tinker et al. (2017b) found a correlation between SSFR and large-scale density at xed M. These observations were consistent with a conditional abundance matching model in which sSFR was matched to halo growth rate: faster growing ha
was matched to halo growth rate: faster growing halos corresponded to higher-than-average star formers. This agrees with the basic ansatz of empirical models based on using the time-dependent SHMR to infer galaxy sSFR. Note that these results would not imply large-scale conformity in the quenched fraction of galax- ies, since this is only found within the star-forming sub-population. Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy (2013a) and Moster, Naab & White (2013) predict that the eciency of converting accre

For halos with 38 Wechsler & Tinker the samez= 0 value of Mh, late-forming halos accrete a higher fraction of their baryons at late times, when this baryon conversion eciency is maximal. Thus, late-forming halos should have higher stellar masses than early-forming halos, an opposite eect from that seen in the theoretical models. To resolve this situation, further analysis is ne
 To resolve this situation, further analysis is needed on both the theoretical and observational sides; analyses of clustering using stellar-mass limited sam- ples, marginalizing over cosmological parameters, are required. Predictions of observables from the theoretical models need to be quantied. Observational methods of determining individual halo masses of low-mass eld galaxies would be a particularly useful tool.

Most of the groups ( ∼97.4%) have at least one halo companion deﬁned in this way, and we assign the formation redshift of the nearest halo to the group. The formation redshift is deﬁned as the highest redshift at which half of the ﬁnal halo mass has assembled into progenitors more massive than 1011.5h−1M⊙(see Neis- tein, van den Bosch & Dekel 2006; Li et al. 2008). The choice of this mass limit is motivated by the fact that it corresponds to the halo mass at which the star formation eﬃciency is

(2007) group catalog, we only search for halo com- panions with 11 .7<log(M/h−1M⊙)<12.0, where the lower mass limit (11 .7) is adopted so that all halos have reliable estimates of halo formation redshifts in the ELU- CID simulation. We have also used other deﬁnitions of halo formation reds
 also used other deﬁnitions of halo formation redshift, such as the redshift at which the main progenitor reaches half of the present-day halo mass. The results are very similar. We refer the reader to paper III for the construction of halo merger trees in ELUCID, which we use to obtain the formation redshifts. A third model, Model C, is then constructed on top of Model B. In Model C, the quenching probability of a model galaxy depends not only on galaxy and halomasses, but also on the formation
n galaxy and halomasses, but also on the formation redshift of its halo. The simplest way to link zfto quenching probability is to assume that a galaxy is quenched when zf>z th,w h e r e zthis a formation redshift threshold. In reality, however, galaxies with given zf,mandM, must have some dis- persion in their star formation rate. To mimic this, we introduce a dispersion in zffor each system before apply- ing the criterion zf>z thto select the quenched fraction. In practice, for a galaxy iwith

y properties and galaxy environment is well established (Balogh et al. 2004; Kaumann et al. 2004; Blanton et al. 2005; Blanton & Berlind 2007). Properties such as color, star-formation rate, Sersic index, and morphology are each cor- related with local galaxy density on all measurable scales. The conclusion of these studies has been that environment mattered most on small scales, and once that environment was xed, correlations on larger scales were eliminated. However, no `ideal' scale for env

A www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 39 galaxy group catalog is used to decompose this relation into central and satellite galaxies. The curves show predictions of a model in which Mis assigned to Mhin a manner similar to abundance matching, but galaxy quenching depends solely on the mass of the host halo.

l galaxies (left-hand panel), even though  is never explicitly used to determine quenching (see also, Peng et al. 2010; Tinker, Wetzel & Conroy 2011). For low-mass central galaxies, the predictions of the model are by construction nearly horizontal lines, with predictions for higher Mbins curved slightly by the trend of Mhwith  within the Mbin, which is stronger at high M. This is an example of spatial correlations in halo mass alone and therefore does not signify assembly bias. The SDSS me
refore does not signify assembly bias. The SDSS measurements for central and satellite galaxies use the group catalog of Yang et al. (2007). For low-mass centrals, the deviation of the data from a horizontal line at high  is due in part to misclassication in the group-nding process (Tinker, Wetzel & Conroy 2011; Tinker et al. 2017c), which may account for the dierences with the model predictions. The strongest correlation with  comes from the satellite galaxies. But this correlation, once a

But this correlation, once again, is not due to  per se but to the change in the halo mass function with ; higher mass halos live in higher density regions, yielding the strong correlation of fqwith  for satellite galaxies. Intragroup environment|scales of 100 kpc or so|also correlates with fq(Blanton & Berlind 2007; Peng et al. 2010; Wetzel, Tinker & Conroy 2012). This correlation can also be explained without invoking environment, through the delayed-then-rapid model 
environment, through the delayed-then-rapid model of satellite quenching (Wetzel et al. 2013). Older satellites are more likely to be quenched, and older satellites are more likely to be near the center of the group, where densities are higher. A model based entirely on time since accretion is consistent with the correlation betweenfqand location within the group, although we note that it is not a unique solution to the problem. 6.4. Galaxy Sizes An important question is whether galaxy radial si
 An important question is whether galaxy radial size at xed halo mass is correlated with a second halo property, and if so what that property is. Classic models of galaxy formation (Fall & Efstathiou 1980; Mo, Mao & White 1998) have based the radial sizes of galaxies on the spin of their dark matter halos, and predict that they should be proportional to that spin and to the size of the halo. However, there have been somewhat confusing signals in the literature on whether the amount of scatter i
 the literature on whether the amount of scatter in sizes at xed galaxy or halo properties are consistent with these models, as well as whether the multivariate correlations between galaxy mass and size at xed halo mass and radius are what one would predict. Kravtsov (2013) explored the question of how galaxy size is related to halo properties in a standard abundance matching model, matching stellar mass to halo mass. They showed that in this model one obtains an approximately linear relation 
odel one obtains an approximately linear relation between the galaxy half-mass radius and the halo radius, with tight scaling across six decades of mass: Rg0:015Rhalo, with scatter of 0.2 dex and with fairly similar scaling for elliptical and spiral galaxies. This agrees well with predictions of simple models where galaxy sizes are set by the angular momentum of their halos. Somerville et al. (2018) compared the conditional size function at a given stellar mass and concluded that the width of t
ven stellar mass and concluded that the width of the distribution is roughly consistent with the ansatz in which galaxy size is proportional to the standard assumption of spin times the halo size. However, they found a signicant trend in the ratio of galaxy size vs. halo size with both stellar mass and redshift, which is in tension with that ansatz, because 40 Wechsler & Tinker the spin should not depend strongly on halo mass or redshift. Desmond & Wechsler (2017) also found that the resulting 
d & Wechsler (2017) also found that the resulting scatter in the Tully-Fisher relation was larger than one might expect from these simple models. The theoretical results of Somerville et al. (2018) and Desmond et al. (2017), using dierent techniques, have found an anti-correlation between stellar mass and size at xed halo mass, such that smaller galaxies live in more massive halos at xed M. Hearin et al. (2017) recently proposed a conditional abundance matching model for galaxy sizes, which

This is not by itself conclusive, as galaxy clustering strength is a function of both halo mass and other properties, including satellite fraction and halo assembly bias. This model is consistent with measuring a higher lensing signal for larger galaxies at xed stellar mass as was found by Charlton et al. (2017), but we caution that this trend may depend
 (2017), but we caution that this trend may depend on stellar mass as well as on whether the galaxy samples are color selected. We expect that upcoming clustering and lensing surveys should be able distinguish these multivariate relations and their evolution with signicantly higher precision. 7. APPLICATIONS OF THE GALAXY{HALO CONNECTION Parameterized descriptions of the galaxy{halo connection provide an eective way to syn- thesize diverse datasets, and have wide-ranging application in astroph
sets, and have wide-ranging application in astrophysics and cosmology. Below, we highlight three of the major areas in which they have been applied: understand- ing the physics of galaxy formation ( x7.1), inferring cosmological parameters ( x7.2), and probing the properties and distribution of dark matter ( x7.3). 7.1. Understanding the Physics of Galaxy Formation We have discussed several of the key insights into galaxy formation that have been informed by studies of the galaxy{halo connection
 informed by studies of the galaxy{halo connection, as well as the interplay between physical and empirical models. We summarize a few of the most interesting aspects here. Which halo properties are most important in setting the properties of galaxies? Constraints on the galaxy{halo connection can give us signicant and robust information about which properties of dark matter halos and their environ- ments are most important in setting the properties of galaxies. This includes for example to wh
rties of galaxies. This includes for example to what extent the star formation rates of galaxies are set by mass, other structural properties of the halos, properties of the mass accretion history, or large scale environment. Star formation histories and quenching: A new generation of empirical models is now able to trace galaxy histories through time and constrain them with complex combinations of data, including the evolution of the SMF, the relationship between SFR and stellar mass, the evol
elationship between SFR and stellar mass, the evolution of spatial properties with time, and measurements from galaxy lensing. This has provided signicant insight into galaxy star formation histories and quenching timescales over the full range of observed galaxies. We expect data taken in the near future will provide larger samples to test the spatial and lensing properties at higher redshifts, and provide further insight into the physical mechanisms of star formation and quenching. Feedback:
anisms of star formation and quenching. Feedback: The basic shape of the SHMR has been primary evidence for strong feed- back in galaxy formation, over a range of masses (there is additional direct evidence www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 41 of the processes that lead to this shape, including for example observations of galactic winds). Although empirical constraints cannot directly probe the physical processes involved, as these constraints improve, they provide increasingly 
se constraints improve, they provide increasingly accurate targets for the strength of feedback and its dependence on halo mass, redshift, and environment that any physical model must meet. Particular examples include that the shape of the SHMR at the massive end constrains the strength of AGN feedback, and the size of the scatter in the SHMR likely puts constraints on what galaxy or halo properties are most responsible for halo quenching. Downsizing: A persistent puzzle in galaxy formation in 
izing: A persistent puzzle in galaxy formation in the context of CDM was the observation that although CDM predicts that small halos accrete a larger fraction of their dark matter at late times than large halos, small galaxies form a smaller fraction of their stars at late times than large galaxies. This apparent inconsistency can be understood by the fact that most star formation happens in a fairly narrow band of halo mass (see Figure 9 and discussion in Conroy & Wechsler 2009 and Behroozi, W
scussion in Conroy & Wechsler 2009 and Behroozi, Wechsler & Conroy 2013b). A detailed understaning of the combination of physical eects that lead to this narrow range of ecient star formation is still missing. Merging, galaxy disruption, and the intracluster light: Galaxy merging rates have long been considered a test of structure formation and are critical for under- standing how galaxies form, but are highly sensitive to the galaxy{halo connection for a given halo population (Stewart et al.
ection for a given halo population (Stewart et al. 2009). Models with constraints on the galaxy{halo connection over time have made predictions for the buildup of the intr- acluster light over time and its mass dependence (Purcell, Bullock & Zentner 2007; Conroy, Wechsler & Kravtsov 2007). Models for the evolution of the galaxy{halo connection can also shed light on what fraction of galaxy build-up is due to mergers; e.g. Behroozi et al. (2018) nd this to be a strongly increasing function of ma
nd this to be a strongly increasing function of mass, with nearly all of dwarf galaxy buildup due to in situ star formation and most of present-day massive galaxy buildup due to mergers. We expect that as we become more able to empirically constrain the relationship be- tween multi-variate properties of the galaxy{halo connection, constraints on these and other aspects of galaxy formation physics will improve signicantly. 7.2. Inferring Cosmological Parameters Future galaxy surveys will provide
ical Parameters Future galaxy surveys will provide tremendous power for high precision cosmological con- straints, especially if clustering measurements can be pushed to smaller scales, within the trans-linear or non-linear regime where the galaxy{halo connection is of increasing impor- tance. For many statistics, the spatial scale at which the minimum fractional error is achieved is in the range of 1 r10 Mpc (see discussion of Figure 13 ). This is true even for surveys that are specically de
s is true even for surveys that are specically designed to probe structure on linear scales, such as measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. However, galaxy bias is highly complex at these scales. Higher-order perturbation theory generally breaks down at scales around 10{ 20 Mpc, or at larger scales for redshift-space clustering (Carlson, White & Padmanabhan 2009; Wang, Reid & White 2014). Thus, extracting information out of Mpc scales requires a model that is fully non-linear. The galaxy

The galaxy{halo connection provides such a model, pro- vided the model is exible enough to incorporate any systematic uncertainties, including the accuracy of predictions for scale-dependent halo clustering, galaxy assembly bias, and 42 Wechsler & Tinker 3x2ptFigure 13: Top Left: Projected galaxy clustering for ve cosmological models that vary 8.

In general, the pathway to cosmological constraints using halo occupation methods starts with measurements of projected galaxy clustering, either through wp(rp) or the angular correlation function w().

Thus, the occupation functions constrained bywp(rp) can be used to make predictions for statistics that contain more cosmologically sensitive information. These include RSDs, the mass-to-number ratio of galaxy clusters, and galaxy{galaxy lensing, which are shown in the bottom panels of Figure 13 and discussed in more detail below. Redshift

Galaxy redshifts are a function of not just the smooth Hubble ow but also `peculiar' motions caused by the local gravitational potential, which causes galaxies to move toward overdensities and away from underdensities. Thus, the spatial distribution of galaxies in redshift space will have anisotropies due to the amplitude of the velocity eld. The velocity eld is, in turn, determined by the amount of matter in the universe, 
termined by the amount of matter in the universe, how clumpy that distribution is, and by the theory of gravity. Current analyses of RSD yield 10% measurements of the parameter combination f8, wherefis the logarithmic growth of structure and 8is the amplitude of matter uctuations (Alam et al. 2017).

This panel also shows the expected measurement error for a full BOSS-like survey based on mock galaxy catalogs. As discussed above, the `sweet spot' for optimal measurements is in the 1{10 Mpc regime, where sample variance is minimized but shot noise due to small number statistics is avoided. The most constraining power between models comes at r1 Mpc, which represents the transition between pairs of galaxies between two distinct halos and pairs within a single halo. Galaxy pairs within a single
within a single halo. Galaxy pairs within a single halo have larger relative velocities, leading to signicant suppression of clustering. As can be seen in the mean occupation functions, the fraction of galaxies that are satellites varies inversely with 8, thus the model with the largest fsathas the largest pairwise velocity dispersion at r1 Mpc, and the lowest 0(r) at this scale. The mass-to-number ratio of galaxy clusters ( M=N):This statistic is analogous to the mass-to-light ratios of gal
ic is analogous to the mass-to-light ratios of galaxy clusters, but reduced the number of free model pa- rameters by simply counting the number of galaxies, N, inside a halo. From the mean occupation functions shown in Figure 13 , it is clear that measurements of the mean occu- pation themselves contain cosmological information. The bottom-middle panel of the gure shows predictions for M=N from the ve cosmologies t to the DR10 BOSS wp(rp). Here, the quantity M=N is normalized by the ratio cr

Points with errors represent estimates of the uncertainties achievable in a BOSS-like survey at z<0:3. Errors in halo masses are taken from the weak lensing analysis of RedMaPPer clusters by Murata et al. (2018), which are added in quadrature with the expected Poisson noise from the number of clusters in the survey volume
e from the number of clusters in the survey volume (although the mass estimates dominate the error bar). M=N andM=L have been eectively used to constrain cosmological parameters with low-redshift data (van den Bosch, Mo & Yang 2003; Tinker et al. 2012), and new large-scale redshift and lensing surveys make application to larger volumes imminent. Red- dick et al. (2014) showed that with current constraining power, simple HODs are sucient to obtain unbiased parameter constraints, but as the stat

Galaxy{galaxy lensing: Galaxy{galaxy lensing is a probe of the galaxy{matter cross correlation, and it is sensitive to both the matter density and amplitude of matter uc- tuations.

Observational uncertainties in this quantity are shown from Leauthaud et al. (2017), which uses deep CFHTLS (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey) imaging in the Stripe 82 eld of the BOSS spectroscopic survey. Note that this survey only covers 200 deg2, which is only 2% of the full spectroscopic BOSS cata- log. Even this small area yie

Even this small area yields constraining power to distinguish these models, indicating the substantial potential of future combinations of large area spectroscopic and imaging surveys. Cacciato et al. (2013) and More et al. (2015) have demonstrated the ecacy of joint clustering and lensing analyses for constraining cosmological parameters in the halo occupation framework. 3x2pt: As discussed above, combinations of two-point statistics can break degeneracies in the gala

A recent study from the Dark Energy Survey (DES Collaboration et al. 2017) used a combination of galaxy{galaxy clustering, shear-shear clustering, and galaxy-shear clustering to put the tightest constraints yet on 8and  min the local Universe (and see related work by Kil- binger et al. 2013 and van Uitert et al. 2018). To date, these analyses have assumed linear bias between the g
se analyses have assumed linear bias between the galaxy clustering and matter clustering and exclude small scales where this assumption is expected to fail from the analyses. However, substantially more constraining power may be available if the modeling can be extended to smaller scales (Krause & Eier 2017); a full comparison between constraints with a fully nonlinear modeling approach with a parameterized galaxy{halo connection and a quasi-linear approach with a smaller number of bias paramet
ear approach with a smaller number of bias parameters has yet to be done. As these examples demonstrate, pushing to smaller scales has signicant potential to improve cosmological constraints from current and upcoming datasets, but there are sig- nicant challenges to realize this potential, many of which are related to aspects of the galaxy{halo connection. These include the following: Modeling in the non-linear regime: Historically, researchers have either used t- ting functions for the prope
 have either used t- ting functions for the properties of dark matter halos to model galaxy clustering, or have used simulations directly when modeling a range of galaxy clustering models within one cosmological model. Achieving the required accuracy for these tting functions is espe- cially challenging in the regime in which there is signicant power in the data, 1{10 Mpc. Methods based on perturbation theory or eective eld theory (Perko et al. 2016) may be eective in the mildly non-linear
al. 2016) may be eective in the mildly non-linear regime, but they will not be eective in modeling collapsed regions. The solution may be to emulate the statistics directly (e.g. using techniques similar to those that Heitmann et al. 2010 used for the dark matter power spectrum), using suites of simulations combined with exible models of the galaxy{halo connection. Assembly bias: As discussed in Section 4.4, our understanding of the detailed depen- dence of galaxy properties on halo propertie
epen- dence of galaxy properties on halo properties other than their mass is still in the early stages, and improved modeling will be essential to take small-scale cosmology probes that depend on accurate galaxy clustering models to the next stage. In particular, what is needed is a modeling framework that is exible enough to encompass the full range of physically plau- sible manifestations of the complexities of assembly bias for realistic galaxy populations, without losing substantial constra
xy populations, without losing substantial constraining power; this has yet to be demonstrated. Impact of baryons: Precision cosmology on small-scales will also require understand- ing the possible range of impacts of galaxy formation and feedback on the matter distribu- tion itself (Rudd, Zentner & Kravtsov 2008; Semboloni et al. 2011; Schneider & Teyssier www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 45 2015), including its implications for the mass function and clustering of dark matter h
 the mass function and clustering of dark matter halos and subhalos (van Daalen et al. 2011; Sawala et al. 2013; Martizzi et al. 2014). We are still far from being able to simulate the full range of possibilities over a range of cosmological models in order to directly emulate these eects using hydrodynamical simulations, so em- pirical modeling of the eects, informed by our best physical models, will likely remain the best path forward for the foreseeable future. The primary impact on the pow
 foreseeable future. The primary impact on the power spectrum can be characterized by a change in galaxy density proles (Zentner, Rudd & Hu 2008), but this may not be sucient for all observable statistics. Additional observables should be combined to put constraints on the possible amount of feedback; e.g. the small-scale shear power spectrum (Foreman, Becker & Wechsler 2016) and the SZ proles of groups and clusters (Battaglia et al. 2017). Intrinsic alignments: Weak gravitational lensing (se
trinsic alignments: Weak gravitational lensing (see Mandelbaum 2018 for a recent review) depends on the spatial correlations between small distortions in galaxy shapes; if galaxy shapes are aligned with their dark matter halos or with the tidal eld, this creates a systematic error that has to be modeled. Dierent galaxy populations have been shown to have dierent intrinsic alignments, so in detail one would like to model not just the halo occupation as a function of galaxy properties but also 
ation as a function of galaxy properties but also the alignment of galaxies with their halos (Schneider & Bridle 2010; Blazek, Vlah & Seljak 2015). Additional aspects: Accurate modeling of the galaxy{halo connection will continue to be an important feature of the next generation of cosmological studies, even for those studies that are not pushing to small scales or explicitly including a galaxy{halo connection model. Examples include the following: Understanding the error budget in photometric 
g: Understanding the error budget in photometric redshift estimates will require eec- tively modeling the clustering properties of galaxies as a function of their properties (Hoyle et al. 2017; Gatti et al. 2017); this is most eectively done directly through tests with realistic mock catalogs that populate galaxies in halos. Realistic modeling of galaxy clustering on small scales will be required to understand key systematics like ber selection in spectroscopic surveys and deblending in fut
ion in spectroscopic surveys and deblending in future imaging surveys (Chang et al. 2013). Systematics in cluster cosmology, for example projection and centering eects that impact the mass{richness relationship, can depend on the details of the galaxy{halo connection including its radial distribution and color dependence. 7.3. Probing the Properties and Distribution of Dark Matter The nature of the dark matter that makes up 83% of the mass in the Universe is still unclear, and an understandin
the Universe is still unclear, and an understanding of the galaxy{halo connection can facilitate astrophysical constraints on its nature as well as inform constraints from indirect and direct detection. Although the CDM model has had remarkable success on large scales, especially e.g. at larger than the typical sizes of dark matter halos, it is less constrained on smaller scales, where alternative dark matter models can suppress the power spectrum or change the den- sity proles or dynamics of 
um or change the den- sity proles or dynamics of halos (Buckley & Peter 2017). Understanding and marginalizing over the range of possibilities for the galaxy{halo connection can be critical to robust dark matter constraints in this regime. More generally, there are wide-ranging problems where understanding the properties of the dark matter halos of a specic galaxy or population of galaxies is important, and statistical modeling of the possible halo population of the galaxies provides a way for
halo population of the galaxies provides a way forward. We give a few examples of these applications here. 46 Wechsler & Tinker Dwarf galaxies and other probes of small-scale power in CDM are sensitive to the physics of dark matter, but these constraints are in many cases degenerate with un- certainties in the galaxy{halo connection (Lovell et al. 2012; Angulo, Hahn & Abel 2013). There has been signicant progress on understanding this interplay in recent years, due to new observations and impr
 in recent years, due to new observations and improved predictions from hydrodynamical sim- ulations, as well as more sophisticated modeling of the galaxy{halo connection. We refer the reader to Bullock & Boylan-Kolchin (2017) for a more detailed discussion. One of the key tools used to search for WIMP dark matter is indirect detection using gamma rays, looking for the high-energy photons that would be emitted by annihilating dark matter particles in the regions in which they have the highest d
es in the regions in which they have the highest density (see Strigari 2013, for a review). The strongest individual sources are the center of the Milky Way itself and its nearby dwarf galaxies (Ackermann et al. 2015), but several authors have also considered the stacked signals from groups and clusters of galaxies. For example, Lisanti et al. (2018b,a) showed that interesting constraints on the dark matter properties could be obtained by looking for excess Fermi signal around hundreds of galaxy
 for excess Fermi signal around hundreds of galaxy groups in the low redshift ( z <0:03) Universe. Accurate mass estimates for the galaxy groups are critical to this estimate, which requires an understanding of the galaxy{halo connection. Is the Milky Way a typical galaxy? Because there are so many measurements that can only be made within the Milky Way or the Local Group, this is a critical question for a wide range of science applications. Our increasing understanding of the statistical galax
 increasing understanding of the statistical galaxy{halo connection has informed our understanding of the cosmological context of the Milky Way itself. There is evidence that the Milky Way is more compact than a typical galaxy of its luminosity and circular velocity (Licquia, Newman & Bershady 2016), and also that it may have more bright satellites and more quenched classical satellites than a typical halo of its mass (Geha et al. 2017; Busha et al. 2011). The properties of the Milky Way itself
al. 2011). The properties of the Milky Way itself and its relationship to cosmological predictions is also relevant for measurements of direct detection. In particular, the velocity distribution function of dark matter halos depends signicantly on the mass and concentration of the halos; these halo properties are best constrained through the galaxy{halo connection (Mao et al. 2013; Mao, Strigari & Wechsler 2014). Gravitational time delays in strong lenses provide a measurement of cosmological
trong lenses provide a measurement of cosmological distance (Treu & Marshall 2016). However, additional mass from galaxies and their halos along the line of sight to the systems can also impact the signal and is an important systematic uncertainty in these measurements. In this case, one has a set of galaxies and would like to know the total mass distribution of the halos surrounding them. This can be done using models of the galaxy{halo connection as discussed in this review; Collett et al. (20
on as discussed in this review; Collett et al. (2013) showed that knowledge of the external shear could be improved by 30% using such an approach. The predicted amount of substructure in a given system is highly dependent on the mass and concentration of a given dark matter halo (Mao, Williamson & Wechsler 2015). In order to predict the substructure for a given system of galaxies, one needs a model for the expected mass and concentration given the observed galaxy properties. This is important i
he observed galaxy properties. This is important in modeling strong lensing systems (Vegetti et al. 2012; Hezaveh et al. 2016), as well as for predicting signals from indirect detection. www.annualreviews.org The Galaxy{Halo Connection 47 8. STATUS AND OUTLOOK Empirical studies of the galaxy{halo connection have exploded since their birth roughly 15 years ago. They are now an essential tool in the interpretation of galaxy surveys for both galaxy formation and cosmology. These models have provid
 formation and cosmology. These models have provided key insights into the problems of galaxy formation and evolution. They also play an increasing role in cosmo- logical modeling and in understanding the physics of dark matter. Accurate methodologies have been developed for modeling the galaxy{halo connection, and there is increasing in- terplay between modeling approaches (from physical to empirical models, and from simple few parameter models to more exible models with tens of parameters) th
to more exible models with tens of parameters) that leverages the strengths of each of them. Some of the key aspects of the galaxy{halo connection that have been learned from this body of research are as follows: Galaxy formation is surprisingly inecient: the eciency of turning gas into stars peaks at20{30% of the baryon fraction in halos of 1012Mand is signicantly lower for higher and lower mass halos. The stellar masses of central galaxies are a strong function of dark matter halo mass
ies are a strong function of dark matter halo mass below 1012M, scaling like M/M2 3 h, and a weaker function above this pivot point, M/M1=3 h. Galaxy masses are tightly connected to the masses of their dark matter halos. If halo properties are considered before substantive stripping by more massive systems, the scatter in galaxy stellar mass or luminosity at xed halo mass has a scatter of less than 0.2 dex for objects above 1012Mwhere it is well measured; this likely increases by no more t
 well measured; this likely increases by no more than a factor of two at lower mass. For most of the Universe's history from z8{0, the bulk of all star formation occurs in galaxies that live in a narrow range of halo mass around 1012M. Most galaxies at any stellar mass are the central galaxies in their own dark matter halo; the fraction of satellite galaxies at a given galaxy stellar mass declines from 30% at low mass to 5% at high mass. Most trends of galaxy properties with large-scale e
ost trends of galaxy properties with large-scale environment can be reasonably well explained by the fact that the halo mass function and average halo properties vary with environment, combined with a galaxy{halo connection that is independent of environment. Although halo mass is the dominant determinant of the state of the galaxy occupying it, there is statistically signicant evidence that some galaxy properties are inuenced by other halo properties, and that this manifests in galaxy cluste
operties, and that this manifests in galaxy clustering properties (as- sembly bias). The next generation of surveys is likely to transform the study of the galaxy{halo connection into a precision science, including enabling the community to pin down the dependence of the wide range of multi-modal galaxy properties on the key properties of dark matter halos and their environments within the cosmic web. These surveys include massive imaging and spectroscopic surveys from the ground and space whose
ctroscopic surveys from the ground and space whose combination will jointly constrain the abundance and clustering of galaxies and the mass distribution around them, as well as surveys of 21-cm, UV absorption, X-rays, and the CMB at high resolution that will map the gas and its connection to galaxies and their halos. In the next decade, we expect that our understanding of the detailed connection between galaxies and halos over mass, redshift, and environment will provide major strides forward 48
 environment will provide major strides forward 48 Wechsler & Tinker in galaxy formation, cosmological parameters, and the nature of dark energy and neutrino mass, and in understanding the nature of dark matter. At the same time, it is clear that for this promise to be realized, the precision of models for the galaxy{halo connection will need to keep up with the pace of the data. In closing, we highlight some of the most interesting near-term future issues. FUTURE ISSUES 1. The detailed manifest

This has important consequences for interpreting measurements of dwarf galaxies in the context of dark matter models. 3.

We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertaintieson our results, incl uding those affecting stellar masses, star formation rates, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis .

An ever growing number of galaxy observations have been made, covering a time period from 500 Myr after the Big Bang (e.g. Zhengetal. 2012) to the present day. A mode
 (e.g. Zhengetal. 2012) to the present day. A model ofgalaxyformationthatcanmatchobservationsoverthisen - tire stretch of time would represent a signiﬁcant aid to our understanding. So far, matching the evolution of the stel- lar masses and star formation rates of galaxies over this en- tire epoch with has proved difﬁcult (see, e.g., Luet al. 2012 ; Borgani& Kravtsov 2011; Weinmannet al. 2012). Despite challenges of reproducing these observations with detaile d models of galaxy formation, signiﬁ
 with detaile d models of galaxy formation, signiﬁcant progress has been made in recent years with empirical models that connect the evolutionof galaxypropertiesto the evolutionof dark matt er halos. Over the past decade, a range of studies have associated galaxies with dark matter halos at a given epoch, using a variety of techniques, including Halo Occupation Distribu - tion modeling (e.g., Berlind&Weinberg 2002; Bullocketal. 2002) the Conditional Luminosity Function modeling (e.g., Yanget al.
nal Luminosity Function modeling (e.g., Yanget al. 2003), and variants of the abundance matching technique (e.g., Colínet al. 1999; Kravtsov&Klypin 1999; Neyrincket al. 2004; Kravtsovet al. 2004; Vale &Ostriker 2004, 2006; Tasitsiomi etal. 2004; Conroyet al. 2006; Shankaretal. 2006; Berrieret al. 2006; Marínet al. 2008; Guoetal. 2010; Mosteret al. 2010; Behrooziet al. 2010). The simplest abundance matching models assign the mostmassiveobservedgalaxiesinrankordertothelargesthalos in an equal simu
axiesinrankordertothelargesthalos in an equal simulation volume. With only slight modiﬁcations (e.g., using the peak mass for satellite halos), this techni que accuratelyreproducestheredshift–andscale–dependentc lus- tering of galaxies (e.g., Conroyet al. 2006; Reddicket al. 2012). Because the cosmological model provides a prediction for the buildup of dark matter halos, one can combine knowl- edge of the galaxy-halo connection at different epochs with knowledge of the mass accretion and merger 
s with knowledge of the mass accretion and merger histories of halos to constrain the buildup of stellar mass in galaxies over cosmic time. This was ﬁrst done in a comprehensive way by Conroy& Wechsler (2009), who provided an em- pirical constraint on the star formation histories and stel lar mass growth in galaxies from z= 2 to the present. This approach has been explored in several studies using vari- antsofthe techniques(Zhenget al. 2007b; White et al. 2007; Firmani& Avila-Reese 2010; Leitner
te et al. 2007; Firmani& Avila-Reese 2010; Leitner 2012; Bétherminet al. 2012; Wanget al. 2013; Mosteret al. 2013), which together provide important constraints on the basic picture for the buildupofstarsingalaxiesandtheirconnectiontodarkmat ter halos. These studies represented important advances, albeit with shortcomings. For example, most of these studies only mod- eled galaxy evolution from z∼2 to the present due to per- ceivedconﬂictsbetweenthe integratedcosmic star formati on and the cosmic
he integratedcosmic star formati on and the cosmic stellar mass density at z>1 (Wilkinset al. 2008; Hopkins& Beacom 2006). In addition, because pas- sive stellar mass loss (e.g., supernovae of massive stars) d e- 2 BEHROOZIETAL pends on galaxies’ star formation histories, these studies had to make assumptions about the ages of stars already formed atz>2. Finally, these studies paid limited attention to the vast array of observational uncertainties as well as modeli ng uncertaintiesaffectingtheir
s as well as modeli ng uncertaintiesaffectingtheirderivedconstraints;indee d,many results are presented without error bars (Conroy&Wechsler 2009; Firmani& Avila-Reese 2010; Bétherminet al. 2012; Wanget al.2013). Here we present a new technique and a new compilation of observations,aimed squarelyat resolvingthese issues. On the observational side, new observations of galaxies at ver y high redshifts (e.g. Bouwensetal. 2011; Bradleyet al. 2012 ; Bouwensetal. 2012; McLureetal. 2011) have made it po
uwensetal. 2012; McLureetal. 2011) have made it pos- sible to place constraints on galaxy formation all the way to z∼8. Atlowerredshifts,wepresenttheﬁrstconstraintsfrom stellar mass functions based on the PRIMUS survey, as well as from a new analysis at z=0 based on SDSS and GALEX data (Moustakaset al. 2013). These are obtainedfrom a con- sistent methodology from z= 0 to z= 1, and thus allevi- ate many concerns about matching inconsistently-identiﬁe d galaxiesat differentepochs. Using these comb
iﬁe d galaxiesat differentepochs. Using these combineddata set s, we ﬁnd that observations of the evolution of galaxy star for- mation rates and stellar masses can now be reconciled (see alsoBernardietal. 2010andMosteret al.2013). Our new method constrains the galaxy–halorelation using observedgalaxystellarmassfunctions as well as speciﬁcstar formationratesandcosmic star formationrates. Aswith pre - vious studies, we match observed galaxies to halos, but the additional information on star format
los, but the additional information on star formation rates allows us to break degeneracies and directly constrain the buildup of th e intraclusterlight,aswellastheamountofstarsthatcantr ans- fer from satellites to the central galaxy during mergers. We account for a numberof statistical and systematic effects, in- cluding uncertainties from stellar population synthesis m od- els, dust models, star formationhistory models, the faint- end slope of the stellar mass function, observational complete 
the stellar mass function, observational complete - ness,scatter betweenstellar massandhalomass. Givenaparametrizationfortheintrinsicstellarmass—hal o mass relationship as well as for these observational effect s, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to ﬁnd the allowed posterior distribution. This is important n ot onlyforaddressingconcernsthatourresultsmaybebiasedb y limited observational constraints at high redshifts, but i t also gives us the power to determine which observations w

We discuss the observational data sets relevant to our method in §3, with special attention to new measurements of cosmic star formation rates. We discussthe simulations that we use in §4, along with recalibrations of the halo mass function(AppendixG), halo mass accretion rates(AppendixH),andsubhalomerger/disruptionrates(A p- 
(AppendixH),andsubhalomerger/disruptionrates(A p- pendix I). We present our main results in §5, with discussion in§6anda summaryofourconclusionsin§7. Throughout this work, we assume a Chabrier (2003) ini- tial mass function, the stellar population synthesis model of Bruzual& Charlot (2003), and the dust model employed in Blanton& Roweis (2007). We convert data sets from other papers to these models as necessary. We additionally as- sume a ﬂat, ΛCDM cosmology with parameters ΩM= 0.27, ΩΛ=0.73,h=0
DM cosmology with parameters ΩM= 0.27, ΩΛ=0.73,h=0.7,ns=0.95,andσ8=0.82. 2.METHODOLOGY 2.1.Overview Muchpreviousworkhasgoneintodeterminingtherelation between halo mass and stellar mass as a function of redshift (e.g., Mosteret al. 2013; Yanget al. 2012; Leauthaudet al. 2012; Behrooziet al. 2010; Mosteret al. 2010; Guoet al. 2010; Conroy&Wechsler 2009; Wang&Jing 2010; Zhenget al. 2007b; Mandelbaumet al. 2006; Gavazziet al. 2007; Yanget al. 2009a; Hansenet al. 2009; Lin&Mohr 2004).

Hansenet al. 2009; Lin&Mohr 2004). The redshift evolution of this relation is due to thre e contributing physical effects for stars in galaxies (new st ar formation, merging satellite galaxies, and stellar mass lo ss) andoneeffectforhalos(continuingmassaccretion). Mergi ng galaxies and mass accretion are well-constrained by dark matter simulations, and stellar mass loss is well-constrai ned with the assumption of an initial mass function (IMF) for stars. The most uncertain of these effects, in r
r stars. The most uncertain of these effects, in relation to dark matter halos, are new star formation and stars ejected duringgalaxymergers. With observationalconstraintsont he redshift evolution of the stellar mass and the star formatio n rate as well as computed constraints on satellite mass loss, wemayeffectivelyconstrainbothofthesefactors. Schematically, the star formation rate for a given galaxy overa giventimestepisconstrainedby: SFR·∆t=ExpectedStellar MassNow −RemainingStellarMassfromPre

Parametrizing M∗(Mh,z) separately for individual halos is beyond the scope of this work (although it will be explored in future papers). Here, we parametrize the median value of M∗for halos at a given mass and redshift (i.e., a M∗(Mh,z)) as well as the scatter in stellar mass at ﬁxed halo
s well as the scatter in stellar mass at ﬁxed halo mass as a function of redshift. By taking a summation of Eq. 1 over halos in a speciﬁc mass and redshift bin, we can derive the total amount of stars formed in that bin. Thus, dividing by the number of halos in that bin gives the averagestar for- mation rate, which is similar to approachestaken in previou s AverageStar FormationHistoriesFrom Z=0-8 3 works (Conroy& Wechsler 2009; Leitner 2012; Wang etal. 2013;Mosteret al.2013).

Intrinsic Relation As in Behroozietal. (2010), we parametrize the stel- lar mass – halo mass (SMHM) relation at a given epoch. The most commonly-used function is a double power law (Yangetal. 2012; Mosteretal. 2013), which has a charac- teristic halo mass ( M1) and stellar mass ( M∗,0), a low-mass slop
ss ( M1) and stellar mass ( M∗,0), a low-mass slope(α),andahigh-massslope( β). Becauseweincludedata down to low stellar masses ( M∗∼107.25M⊙) and have tight observationalconstraints from the SDSS, we ﬁnd that a dou- ble power-law cannot accurately ﬁt the unique shape of the stellarmassfunction(SMF).AsshowninAppendixD,adou- blepower-lawresultsinastellarmassfunctionoffbyasmuc h as0.1dexat z=0.

While this equation can be- come multiply-valued for Mh<M1, it is straightforward to mitigate this behavior as well as allowing a smooth connec- tiontoapower-lawfor Mh<M1.

We use the virial mass (as deﬁned in Bryan& Norman 1998)todeﬁnethehalomassofcentralgalaxies,andforsate l- lites, we use the peak progenitorvirial mass ( Mpeak). As this paperwasbeingprepared,Reddicket al.(2012)foundthatth e peak vmaxfor halos is an even better proxy for stellar mass, at least at z= 0.05, in agreement with physical expectations that the depth of the halo potential well before it is impacte d by strippin
 potential well before it is impacte d by stripping should be most correlated with the galaxy mass. The use of Mpeakis at present easier both conceptually (to consider mass ratios between galaxies and halos) and opera- tionally (because it allows the use of several previously ca l- ibrated relationships in the literature), so we stick with t his choice in the present work for simplicity. The use of Mpeak may result in slight underestimates of the clustering and th e satellite fraction (see discu
 clustering and th e satellite fraction (see discussion in Reddicket al. 2012 fo r a comparison of these quantities in the local universe). How- ever, §5.6 demonstrates that the differences between our re - sults and the best-ﬁtting stellar mass–halo mass relation o f Reddicket al. (2012) are small, and we expect that they are withinthecurrentsystematicerrors. The redshift scaling of the relation poses a unique chal- lenge. At z= 0, the parameter ﬁts must be ﬂexible enough to match the tight con
 ﬁts must be ﬂexible enough to match the tight constraints from SDSS observations. At higher redshifts, the ﬁt must be ﬂexible enough to allow exploration of possible star formation histories allowed b y higher uncertainties, but not so ﬂexible that it allows sign if- icantover-ﬁttingofthe systematic andstatistical errors inthe data. Moreover,thescalingmustbephysical: obviously,ne g- ative star formation rates cannot be allowed, nor can stella r mass to halo mass ratios that exceed the halo’s ba
mass to halo mass ratios that exceed the halo’s baryon frac- tion. These physical constraints help ensure basic sanity f or the functional form where no observational data exists (for redshifts z>8,aswell asforfaintgalaxies). By necessity, the error bars we obtain will be sensitive to thechoiceof the redshiftﬁt.

Because the latter are oftenpoorlyconstraine dby availabledata, the ﬂexibilityof the redshiftﬁt also inﬂue nces how much of the available nuisance parameter space can be explored. For this reason, we have tried a large number of different redshift scalings, including cubic spline inter pola- tion with many control points (which results in over-ﬁtting ) and many different choices of scaling parameters with aor z—manyofwhichhaveunphysicalbehavioratveryhighred- shifts. 
whichhaveunphysicalbehavioratveryhighred- shifts. We havealsotriedﬁttingdirectlytoabundancematc h- ing results (Appendix E), but no robust trends with redshift emerged. The choice that we settled on has several conventions. For many variables in Eq. 3, we have three parameters: one each for the low-redshift value, one for the scaling at intermedi - ate redshifts (0 .5/lessorsimilarz/lessorsimilar2), and one for scaling at high red- shifts( z/greaterorsimilar2).

Observational Systematics A full discussion of the systematic uncertainties affectin g stellarmassfunctionsmaybefoundinBehrooziet al.(2010) . These include uncertainties from the Initial Mass Function , thestellarpopulationsynthesismodel,thedustmodel,the star formation history model, sample variance, Eddington bias, redshift errors, and magniﬁca

(6) However,some effectscan have different behavioras a func- tion of stellar mass, largely on account of assumptions for passive galaxies (e.g., declining star formation rates and low dust fractions)not being true for active galaxies.

1 .(8) At low redshifts, most galaxies below 1010.2M⊙in stellar mass are active; beyond z=3, nearly all galaxies are consid- eredactive. As in Behroozietal. (2010), we do not model uncertain- ties in the IMF in this work. The most signiﬁcant remaining uncertainties come from the SPS model ( ∼0.1dex), the dust model (∼0.1dex),and the star formationhistory ( ∼0.2dex). Bydeﬁnition,passivegalaxieshavehadnorecentstarforma - tion, so that the star formation history uncertainties are s ub- stantially s
ation history uncertainties are s ub- stantially smaller. For that reason, we take the priors on µto be a log-normaldistribution centered at zero with width 0.1 4 dex (combinedSPS and dust model errors), but the priors on κto be of width 0.24 dex (all three sources combined). Thefunctional form of how µandκevolve with redshift is un- known. We thereforeadoptthefollowingﬁducialformulae: µ=µ0+(a−1)µa (9) κ=κ0+(a−1)κa. (10) Athigherredshifts( z∼2.3),Muzzinet al.(2009)suggestthat uncertaintiesfromSP

Wethussetthewidths ofthepriorson µaandκatobe0.22dexand0.30dex,respec- tively,whichtakethese increaseduncertaintiesintoacco unt. Because stellar populations cannot be fully constrained with limited photometric information, stellar mass estima tes for individual galaxies have intrinsic scatter relative to the true galaxy stellar mass. This causes an Eddington bias (Eddington 1913, 19
 This causes an Eddington bias (Eddington 1913, 1940) in the stellar mass function: on the high-mass end of the SMF, many low-mass galaxies are upscattered, but there are a limited number of higher-mass galaxies that can be downscattered. This results in a net in- crease in the observed numbers of high stellar-mass galax- ies. This effect is best estimated for each redshift range an d modelingtechniqueindividually;whilefewauthorshaveco r- rected for this error, many at least provide an estimate 
for this error, many at least provide an estimate of it s effect. As in Behroozietal. (2010), we ﬁnd that these es- timates depend most signiﬁcantly on the redshift. We thus model the distribution in the observed stellar mass estimat es (compared to the true stellar masses) as a log-normal Gaus- sianwithmean0anda redshift-dependentstandarddeviatio n givenby: σ(z)=σ0+σzz. (11) Following Conroyet al. (2009); Behroozietal. (2010), we take σ0= 0.07 and we take the prior on σzto be σz= 0.04±0.015, co
nd we take the prior on σzto be σz= 0.04±0.015, consistent with estimates from the literature (Conroyetal. 2009; Kajisawa etal. 2009; Pérez-Gonzálezet al. 2008; Marchesinietal. 2009; Starketal. 2009; Caputiet al. 2011; Leeet al. 2011; Marchesiniet al.2010). Finally, there are some concerns that, due to the Lyman break techniques used to detect high-redshift galaxies, no t all high-redshift galaxies may be detected. If galaxies hav e bursty star formation, or if some fraction of star forming gala
ormation, or if some fraction of star forming galaxieshaveextremequantitiesof dust,thennotall galax ies will be detectedin Lymanbreaksurveys(see also Starket al. 2009; Leeet al. 2009). We parametrizethe stellar mass com- pleteness of high-redshift surveys with a two-parameter ﬁt , governingthe amplitude( A) andredshiftonset( zc) of incom- pleteness: ci(z)=1−A exp(zc−z)+1. (12) Becausethereis little reasonto believethat surveysare mi ss- ing a signiﬁcant fraction of galaxies at z<1, we require zc
niﬁcant fraction of galaxies at z<1, we require zc>0.8, and we set the completenessfraction to 1 for z<1.

Presumably, a moderate amount of unobscured star formation would be enough to render a high-redshift galaxy observable—hence, dustiness will im - pactgalaxycompletenessonlyif star formationislargely

Given that models for SFRs from observed galaxies alreadyattempttocorrectfordustobscuration,themainef fect ofdustinessonSSFRsisthattheSSFRsforverydustygalax- ies will not be observed. Therefore,in our currentmodel,we assumethatthishasnoeffectontheaverageSSFR. 2.3.Star Formation Histories Under our assumption of a Chabrier (2003) IMF and Bruzual& Charlot (2003) stellar evolutiontracks, we use th e FSPS package (Conroyet al. 2010; Conr

(Notethatthe re

When a galaxy merger occurs, the stars associated with the satellite galaxy may either be deposited onto the centra l galaxyorbeejectedintotheintrahalolight(IHL),also cal led the intracluster light (ICL) for galaxy clusters. Some care is necessary when using these terms, because there exist two separate deﬁnitions of the ICL/IHL from simulations (i.e.

Becausewecanconstrainthetotalamountofstarsinmerg- ing satellites through the halo merger rate (Appendix I) and the stellar mass – halo mass relation, we can also derive the amountofstellarmassdepositedintotheICL ( ∆ICL): ∆ICL=∆SMincoming−∆SMdeposited,(16) 2Thisrepresents acorrected calibration fromtheﬁtinConro y & Wechsler (2009).where∆SMincomingisthetotalamountofstarsinsatellitesthat merge within ∆t. Note that this quantity

Some fraction of these ejectedstarsmayhavespeedshigherthanthe escapevelocit y of the surrounding dark matter halo and will be scattered to very large distances; however, this fraction is expected to be onthe orderofa fewpercentorless(Behrooziet al.2012). Thissimplepictureismademorecomplicatedbyinconsis- tencies in how galaxies and the ICL are separated. The total luminosity recovered and the 
separated. The total luminosity recovered and the fraction of it attributed to th e galaxy are both dependent on surface-brightness limits, sk y subtraction methods, and galaxy ﬁtting methods, which are different for the different data sets we use and for differen t redshift ranges in the data sets themselves. Over most mass ranges and redshifts, this is not a problem: the rate of star formation in many galaxies results in an overall change in stellar mass between redshifts that is much larger t
ellar mass between redshifts that is much larger than that attributable to a change in the luminosity modeling method. However, for massive galaxies ( M∗>1011M⊙) at low red- shifts ( z<1), this is a more signiﬁcant issue. For example, including 5% more light between z= 0.3 and z= 0.1 in a massive galaxy (0.05 magnitudes) would result in an equal buildupin stellar massas woulda speciﬁc star formationrat e ofabout2.5 ×10−11yr−1(theexpectedSSFRforsuchgalaxies; Salimet al. 2007). As the true SSFR dr
chgalaxies; Salimet al. 2007). As the true SSFR drops to 10−12yr−1, the galaxy models must be self-consistent to about 0.2% (0.002 magnitudes) to avoid introducing a comparable error, which is well beyond current calibration methods (Bernardiet al. 2010). Thissaid,changesinthemassofthegalaxybecauseofdeﬁ- nitionalissuesarecompletelydegeneratewithincomingma ss from mergers in Eqs. 15 and 16: ∆SMdepositedis replaced by thesumofthedeﬁnitionalanddepositedstellarmasschange s (∆SMdeﬁnitional+∆SMdeposit

If we used Eqs. 16 and 15 directly, the star formation rate would have to be parametrized separately from the stellar mass growth. Instead, we rewrite Eq. 15 in terms of the frac- tionofstellarmassgrowththatcomesfromthestarformatio n rate: ∆SMdeposited+∆SMdeﬁnitional=(1−fSFR)∆SMcentral(17) fSFR=SFRcentral∆t ∆SMcentral.(18) Thisisuseful

Low-mass galaxies do not have enough incom- ing stellar mass in satellites to account for a signiﬁcant pa rt of their stellar mass growth, so fSFRasymptotes to 100% for such galaxies. On the other hand, the highest-mass galax- ies experience almost no internal star formation (Salimet a l. 2007), meaning that fSFRmust approach 0 for such galaxies. So, we can approximate the halo mass dependenc

on star for- mation in galaxies: the stellar mass function (SMF), the spe - ciﬁc star formation rate of galaxies (SSFR, star formation rate per unit stellar mass), and the cosmic star formation ra te (CSFR). Stellar mass functionsare discussed in §3.1, cosmi c star formation rates are discussed in §3.3, and speciﬁc star formationratesarediscussedin§3.2. Toensureafaircomparisonbetweenthedifferentdatasets, we convert each measurement to the same set of systematic assumptions. For the initial mass

These are shown in Table3. Different observational challenges present themselves in each redshift range. At low redshifts, the statistics are su f- ﬁcient that systematic error
 statistics are su f- ﬁcient that systematic errors in calculating stellar masse s are the largest source of uncertainty (Behrooziet al. 2010). At higherredshifts,thisisnolongerthecase;statisticalan dsam- ple variance errors can be of equal magnitude to estimated systematic errors. Nonetheless, under the assumption of a smoothlyvaryingstellar mass – halomass (SMHM)relation, our approach (which simultaneously constrains the SMHM relation against many stellar mass functions at different r ed- shif
any stellar mass functions at different r ed- shifts) can constrain the statistical errors better than th e indi- vidualerrorbarsonstellar mass functionsmightsuggest. W e refer the interested reader to Behrooziet al. (2010) for a di s- cussion of the most common uncertainties affecting observa - tion constraintson the stellar mass functionand to §2.2.1f or ourparametrizationof theireffects.

Another possible reason is that star formation at high redshift could be burst y ordust-obscured,yieldinganincompletecensusofgalaxie sin Lyman-breaksurveys(Leeet al. 2009; Starket al. 2009).

In our analysis of recent cosmic SFR literature (§3.2), we ﬁnd that newer estimates of the cosmic SFR are systemat- ically lower at z>3 than the data in Hopkins& Beacom (2006) (see Fig. 2). A similar conclusion is reached in Bernardiet al. (2010) and Mosteret al. (2013). I
n Bernardiet al. (2010) and Mosteret al. (2013). In addition, deep probes of the stellar mass function at lower redshifts (z<1.5) have resulted in ﬁndings of steep faint-end slopes (Baldryet al. 2008; Droryet al. 2009; Mortlocketal. 2011). We ﬁnd this to be strong evidence in support of the explana- tion in Reddy& Steidel (2009).

It has been suggested that this conversion is reasonable given the blue UV continuum slopes of such high-redshift galaxies, and follow-up observations from IRAC that imply that these earlygalaxiesare nearlydust-free(Labbéetal. 2010). At t he same time, concerns arise because the UV luminosity func- tion presented in Bouwensetal. (2011) is steep ( α≈−1.6 to −2.0, instead of the shallower α≈−1.5 to−1.7 at lower red- shifts). One interpretation of this result is that assumpti ons for ga
etation of this result is that assumpti ons for galaxy morphology (and, therefore, the ability to mea- sure estimate the full UV ﬂux or half-light radii) can bias thecalculatedUVluminosityfunctiontohaveasteeperfain t- endslope(Grazianet al.2011). Indeed,anysystematiceffe ct that interferes more with brighter galaxies than with dimme r ones (e.g., dust) will tend to cause an overestimation of the slope of the UV luminosity function. Gonzálezet al. (2011) assume that luminosity-dependentcorrection

This may in fact overestimate the dust corrections,an error that would lowerthe faint-end slope, partially cor- rectingfor a failureto accountforgalaxymorphology.

The inferred star formation rates thus were likely to have been overcorrected in Hopkins&Beacom (2006), al- though substantial uncertainty about the cosmic star forma - tionrateat highredshiftsstill remains.

These cosmologi- calparametersareconsistentwith resultsfrombothWMAP5 (Komatsuet al. 2009) and the latest WMAP7+BAO+H 0re- sults(Komatsuet al.2011). HalosinBolshoiwereidentiﬁedusingR OCKSTAR ,aseven- dimensional halo ﬁnder that uses phase space plus tempo- ral information (Behrooziet al. 2013b).

As discussed in §2, each model in the distributioncontains complete information on the average stellar content and for - mation history of halos as a function of mass and redshift.

Next,in §5.2,we discuss constraints on the stellar mass to halo mass relatio n, bothasafunctionofhistoricalhalomassandasa functionof halomassat z=0. In§5.3,wecomparethetrajectoriesofthe stellar mass and intracluster light (ICL) buildup in galaxi es. Then, in §5.4, we discuss instantaneous baryon conversion efﬁciencies and how they relate to integrated baryon conver - s

Wediscussthemaineffectsoftheuncer - tainties we have modeled in §5.7; ﬁnally, in §5.8, we present new ﬁtting formulaefor individualgalaxystar formationhi s- toriesrelevanttoobservers. 5.1.Star Formation Rates and Histories We show derived star formation rates as a function of halo mass in the left panel of Fig. 5, 
unction of halo mass in the left panel of Fig. 5, and the corresponding star formation histories for galaxies at z= 0 in the right panel. As discussed in §5.3, the contributionfrom merginggalaxie s to the central galaxy is small, so star formation histories f or galaxies at z=0 trace the star formation rate as a function of theirprogenitor’shalomass. Also,forthisreason,starfo rma- tion histories for galaxies at a given redshift zgare nearly the same as for the the z=0 stellar populations,except 
ame as for the the z=0 stellar populations,except truncated atz=zg.5 5Note that this also requires that the halo accretion histori es are similar between the z=zgprogenitors of z=0halos andallsimilar halos ofthesame massastheprogenitors at z=zg;however, thishas been shownto bethecase in McBride etal. (2009).We show similar plotswith one-sigmauncertaintiesin Fig. 6. The left-hand panel demonstrates that the star formation rate at ﬁxed halo mass has been monotonically decreasing sinceveryearlyreds
s been monotonically decreasing sinceveryearlyredshifts. Thisrateofdecreaseisdiffere ntfor different halo masses. At moderate to high redshifts ( z>2), larger halo masses generically have larger average star for - mation rates. However, at lower redshifts, the highest mass halos ( Mh/greaterorsimilar1014M⊙) become so inefﬁcient that they have lower star formation rates than group-scale (1013M⊙) halos orMilky-Waysized(1012M⊙) halos. From the perspective of individual galaxies, it is more il- lumi
ective of individual galaxies, it is more il- luminating to look at the star formation history in the right panel of Fig. 6. Because halos continually gain mass over time, and do so more rapidly at early redshifts, the star for- mation history for galaxies is not monotonically decreasin g. Instead, it increases rapidly with time, approximately as a power law in time. Depending on present-day halo mass, the galaxy’s star formation rate reaches a peak at a redshift between z= 0.5 to z= 2.5 (higher
eak at a redshift between z= 0.5 to z= 2.5 (higher redshifts for higher halo masses) and then decreases until the present day. The rate of decrease depends again on the halo mass, with high halo masses shutting off more rapidly than lower halo masses. Cluster-scale ( Mh/greaterorsimilar1014M⊙) halos form most of their stars rapidly,atearlytimes,whereasgalaxiesinMagellanicClo ud- scale halos (1011M⊙) form stars over an extended period of time(seealso §5.4). 5.2.The Stellar Mass – Halo Mass Relati

In terms of dwarf galaxies ( Mh∼1010M⊙), we only have constraints from observations at z= 0. These have been the subject of recent interest due to the ﬁnding of higher-than- expected stellar mass to halo mass ratios in dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way (Boylan-Kolchinet al. 2012). How- ever,these expectationshave been set largely by the assump - tion that the stellar mass to halo mass
e assump - tion that the stellar mass to halo mass ratio remains a scale- free power law below 1011M⊙. As seen in Fig. 7, the low mass power-law behavior is broken below 1011M⊙, corre- sponding with an upturn in the stellar mass function below 108.5M⊙(Baldryet al.2008)(thisresulthasalsobeenseenby Kravtsov, in prep).

Concerningthe range of allowed SMHM relations, the ob- servational systematics are large enough that our results a re marginally consistent with an unchanging SMHM relation from z= 6 to z= 0.

In our best-ﬁtting model, only 5% of stellar mass in mergers for 1014M⊙halos is allowe
 stellar mass in mergers for 1014M⊙halos is allowed to be deposited onto the central galaxy since z=1, and only 10% for 1013M⊙ha- los. ForMilkyWay-sizedandsmallerhalos,thisnumberrise s rapidly to 70-80%. Yet, due to the sharply decreasing stella r mass to halo mass ratio for lower-mass halos, most of the in- coming stellar mass will be in (rare) major mergers. Central galaxiesarethereforerelativelyuncontaminatedbystars from smaller recently-merged satellites. At higher redshifts, how- ever, larg

For these halos, stellar mass functions alone cannot be used to infer their star formation rates (see also the discussion in §6 andin AppendixJ). Interestingly,in the local universet he transition between merger-dominatedgrowth and star forma - tion growth in the local Universe is roughly the mass of the Milky Way — low mass galaxies are domin

In the left-hand panel of Fig. 11, we show the instantaneous
t-hand panel of Fig. 11, we show the instantaneous conversion efﬁciency at ﬁxed halo mass. Remarkably, this efﬁciency is always highest for Milky-Way sized halos (1012M⊙), corresponding well with the peak in the stellar mass to halo mass ratio seen in Fig. 7. Moreover,thisefﬁciency(20-40%)isconstanttowithinafa c- tor of two over a remarkablylarge redshift range, suggestin g that the efﬁciency is only a weak function of accretion rate in halos of this mass. For more massive halos, there is a de- 
this mass. For more massive halos, there is a de- crease in the baryon conversion efﬁciency following redshi ft 2-3. Thissuggeststhat theabilityofaccretedmaterialtoc ool ontostar-formingregionsbecomesimpairedatlowerredshi fts forsuchhalos. However,thisdecreaseisgradual,takingpl ace over many Gyr (see also Behroozietal. 2013a). Rather than an abrupt change in the character of infalling gas, this may suggest that the decreasing density and accretion rate of ga s make it gradually more difﬁcult for
n rate of ga s make it gradually more difﬁcult for cold clumps to form, es- peciallyin thepresenceofanactivegalacticnucleus. On the right-hand side of Fig. 11, we show the historical baryon conversion efﬁciency for progenitors of z= 0 halos. For massive halos at z=0, their conversionefﬁciency climbs steeply towards higher redshifts as their halo mass falls to roughly1012M⊙;oncetheirhalomassdropsbelowthatvalue, they then become less and less efﬁcient at very high red- shifts. For less-massive hal
ent at very high red- shifts. For less-massive halos, such as those that are 1012M⊙ atz=0, their conversionefﬁciency has been increasing from earlytimesto thepresentday. On the left-handside of Fig. 12, we show extrapolatedhis- torical stellar mass to halo mass ratios—proportional to in - tegrated baryon conversion efﬁciencies—similar to the bot - tom panel of Fig. 7. Notably, stellar mass to halo mass ra- tiosalsopeakwhenhalosreach1012M⊙,indicativeofsteeply fallingstarformationefﬁcienciesathigh

It would appear that the maximum integratedstellar mass ef- ﬁciencyisaround20-40%at all redshifts. 5.5.Stellar Ages In the right-hand panel of Fig. 12, we show the historical stellar mass in progenitors of halos at z= 0 relative to the present-day stellar mass. This should not be confused with Fig. 9, which shows what amount of the currently-remaining stellar mass was in place at a given redshift; these differ mainlybecauseofpa

These data allow us to derive stellar mass-weighted agesas a function of stellar mass, shown in the left-hand panel of Fig.13. Theseagesareconsistentwiththestellarpopulati ons in massive galaxies (and halos) forming at very early times andhavinglittle star formationcontinuingto the present d ay.

While we have litt le information on the progenitors of galaxies less massive tha n 109M⊙, there is evidence that the average ages of the stellar populations may increase for such galaxies. Speciﬁcally, a s shown in the right-hand panel of Fig. 13, the time required to form 50% and 90% of the galaxy’sstars increases towards lower stellar masses, indicating 
ncreases towards lower stellar masses, indicating that the star formation hi sto- ries become more and more ﬂat (constant), on average. A perfectlyﬂatstarformationhistorywouldresultinanaver age age of about half the age of the universe,or roughly6.7 Gyr; this is somewhat higher than that seen for 109M⊙galaxies. On the other hand,for individualdwarfgalaxies, the star fo r- mation history is likely to be stochastic, which may result i n alargescatter aroundthisaveragevalue. For the most massive ga
er aroundthisaveragevalue. For the most massive galaxiestoday ( ∼1012M⊙), the time required to form 50% of their stars was extremely short— only 1–2 Gyr. This in turn translates to a high star forma- tion rate, on the order of 200-1000 M⊙yr−1, which is con- sistent with observations of ultra-luminous infrared gala xies (ULIRGs; Magnelliet al. 2012; Michałowskietal. 2010a,b; Daddiet al.2005; Chapmanet al.2004). 5.6.Comparison to Other Results We show a comparison of our best-ﬁt results for the st

Where possible, conversions to our as- sumedcosmologyandhalomassdeﬁnitionhavebeenapplied. The results in this work are almost identical to our previous results in Behrooziet al. (2010), with the exception of a de- viation at low halo masses due to the updated stellar mass functions used. We also compare to

Most import
softheallowedparameterrangearenotable. Most importantly, there is no necessity for a large number of galaxies to be missed (due to dustiness or burstiness) at high redshift; indeed, the allowed incompleteness is in gen - eral lessthan 30%,as shownin thetop panelofFig. 17. This wouldimplythatmosthigh-redshiftsurveysarenotmissing a large fraction (>50%) of galaxies above their nominal detec - tionthresholds.

havingboth µ= 0 andκ= 0 at z= 0; i.e., no systematic offsets in stellar mass are necessary at z= 0. This is partially by design: the parametrizationof the SMHM was chosen so that it could ﬁt thez= 0 constraints without need for µorκ; moreover, the cosmic and speciﬁc star formation rates are derivative con- straints, meaning that they only constrain how the SMHM evolves with time.

Various modiﬁcations to this form have been suggested (e.g., te−t/τore+t/τin Marastonet al. 2010), and there h
 te−t/τore+t/τin Marastonet al. 2010), and there has been increasing recent evidencethat increasingstar formationhistoriesare more ap- propriateformassivegalaxiesat highredshifts. Ourbestconstraintsinthisstudyareon averagestarforma- tion histories for halos at a given mass. Thus, we can place the strongest priors on the expected form of stacked galaxy star formation histories. However, we can also place some weaker constraints on what individual galaxy star formatio n historiesshouldlooklike. In
galaxy star formatio n historiesshouldlooklike. Individual galaxies’ histories can differ from the average starformationhistoriesforthreereasons. Theﬁrst isstoc has- ticity in the star formation rate on short timescales relati ve to the dynamical time of the halo, due to feedback effects as well as shot noise in the star formation rate. This variation cannot be modeled with our current approach, so we caution that the constraintson individualgalaxyhistories that we de- riveshouldbeconsideredassm

Ifenoughcolorbandsare available to avoiddegen- eracies with other ﬁtting parameters, observersmay consid er adding the possibility of recent starbursts to their models to account for the fact that they can signiﬁcantly alter observ ed galaxycolors.

Finally, we note that differences can arise in individual galaxy star formation histories because of the scatter in st el- lar massesat a givenhalomass, aswell as thescatter in mass accretion histories for halos (see Fig. 19).

This happensat z∼2−3for1011M⊙galaxies,makinga declining exponential at z= 0 a reasonable ﬁt. However, it happens as lateas z=0.5for109.5M⊙galaxies—meaningthatadeclining exponential is nevera good ﬁt for these galaxies unless they are satellites.

SSION The existence of a “cold mode” of gas accretion that al- lowsefﬁcientstarformationathighredshiftsandshutsoff for AverageStar FormationHistoriesFrom Z=0-8 19 massive galaxies past z∼2 has been predicted in hydrody- namical simulations for the past decade (Birnboim& Dekel 2003). Inthiswork,weobserveatransitionafter z∼3,where galaxies in massive halos become progressivelyless efﬁcie nt at forming stars, even after correcting for slowing accreti on ratessincethattime(Fig. 11,rightpanel). Atﬁxe
i on ratessincethattime(Fig. 11,rightpanel). Atﬁxedhalomas s (Fig. 11, left panel), the transition is less severe, but the re has been a clear reduction in the conversion efﬁciency since z∼3 to the present day. This suggests a picture in which dense infalling gas can cool to the galaxy disk efﬁciently at high redshifts; however, at lower redshifts, the infalling gas becomes sparse enough that it is susceptible either to shock heatingorfeedbackfroman activegalacticnucleus. Another important featu
man activegalacticnucleus. Another important feature of our results is that merging galaxies’ stars almost never reach the central galaxy in mas - sive halos ( <10% since z=1 for halos larger than 1013M⊙). Thisclaimisnotnew(Purcellet al.2007;Conroyet al.2007) , but it is reassuring that we duplicate this conclusion with high conﬁdence. This is in stark contrast to what is asserted in (Mosteret al. 2013) (i.e., 80% of merging stars reach the central galaxy); however, their assertion is based on s
al galaxy); however, their assertion is based on sim- ulations of Milky-Way sized halos, for which we ﬁnd that indeed∼70% of merging galaxies’ stars reach the central galaxy. Thus,thefractionofmergingstarsthatreachthece n- tralgalaxyislikelya strongfunctionofhalomass. ItisworthmentioningthattheSFRsderivedinMosteretal. (2013) appear reasonable despite this issue. We note that Mosteretal.(2013)assumesthatsatellitestellarmassisﬁ xed at the epochof accretion,which resultsin less stellar mass in sate
ccretion,which resultsin less stellar mass in satellites thaninthiswork. Additionally,Mosteret al. (2 013) assumesa highervalueofthe scatter in observedstellar mas s vs. true stellar mass ( σ) than we do, whichcomesfromcom- paring technique-to-techniquescatter in recovering obse rved stellarmasses. Thisresultsinamuchlargerallowedevolut ion for massive galaxies between z= 1 and z= 0, which is very sensitivetothe valueof σ(Behrooziet al. 2010). Thecombi- nationofthesetwoassumptions(lessstellarmass
combi- nationofthesetwoassumptions(lessstellarmassinsatell ites and greater allowed evolution in the stellar mass of massive galaxies) roughly cancels the effect on the SFR of assuming that more stellar mass in satellites is allowed to merge into the central galaxy. We note, however,that our satellite ste llar massesarealreadyonthelowsideofwhatisallowedbyclus- teringconstraints(Reddicket al. 2012),leavinglittle ro omto reducethemfurtherasisdoneintheMosteret al.(2013)anal - ysis. In addition, the

In addition, the scatter in the difference between two stellar mass estimation techniques tends to overestimate t he scatterbetweenanyonetechniqueandthetruevaluebyafac- tor of∼√ 2. This factor is consistent with other independent estimates of σ, for example, by evaluating the posterior dis- tribution of allowed recovered stellar masses (Kajisawa et al. 2009; Conroyet al. 2009). Thus, both the actual evolutionin the stellar mass of massive galaxies and the fracti

We note further that the amount of stellar mass that was containedindisruptedgalaxiescaneasilyreachﬁvetimest he amountofstellarmassinthecentralgalaxyforhigh-massha - los (Fig. 9), consistent with observations in Gonzalezetal .

Rather, stars from merging galaxies must end up in amore extended distribution to avoid confusion with the cen- tral galaxy, a topic that will be explored in depth in a future paper (Behroozi et al., in prep). From the opposite perspec- tive, galaxy stellar populations contain mostly stars from the most-massiveprogen

Theprogenitorsoftoday’smassivehalos( /greaterorsimilar1014M⊙) passed throughthismassquickly,andasaresultformedmostofthei r stars in a short time: a mere 1–2 Gyr (Fig. 13). Given that baryon to star conversion becomes so inefﬁcient above and below this halo mass, much of the shape of the star forma- tionhistoriesseeninthispaper(Fig.6)couldbeexplained by considering the duration of time that a given halo’s mass ac- cretion history spends close to this most efﬁcient
cretion history spends close to this most efﬁcient halo mass . That is to say, the peakiness of the star formation history de - pends on how quickly the halo mass accretion history passes throughhalos of mass ∼1012M⊙. As lower-mass halos have slowerrelativeaccretionrates,theyhaveﬂatterstarform ation histories; e.g., Milky Way-sized halos have lingered in thi s massrangefrom z∼1,andsohavethecurrenthigheststellar masstohalomassratio,aswellasstarformationhistoriest hat tracktheirhalomassaccretionra

In the left pane l ofFig.11,itwouldappearthattheinstantaneousbaryoncon - version efﬁciency of 1011M⊙halos is high at high redshifts (z>5), low at intermediate redshifts (2 <z<5), and then highagainatlowredshifts.

Forthatreason,observationalbiasesmaybethemo st likelysourceofthisbehavior. Our results have importance for future observational stud- ies.

As discussed in §5.8, we have provided new ﬁtting formulas for galaxy star formation his- tories, whi

Our approach providesa self-consisent pic ture of the growthof galaxiesoverthis epochin the cosmological context of ΛCDM structure formation. The model is able to match the ev
cture formation. The model is able to match the evolution of cosmic star formation rates, speciﬁc star formation rates, and the stellar mass function of galax - ies over the last 13.2 billion years of cosmic time. Our main ﬁndingsareasfollows: 1. Halosofmass ∼1012M⊙appeartobethemostefﬁcient atformingstarsateveryepoch,withbaryonconversion efﬁciencies of 20-40% over nearly the entire redshift range of this study. Halos at higher and lower masses are less efﬁcient by orders of magnitude, especially

The baryon conversion efﬁciency of more massive ha- losisstillreasonablyhigh(10-20%)until z=2−3,after whichtimeittakesasteepdownturn. Thisisconsistent with expectationsof reducedcold mode accretiononto the correspondinggalaxies. 3. We have characterized the fraction of stars in galax- ies due to merging vs star formation.

We ﬁnd, however, that the fraction of merging starsthatreachthecentralgalaxymayincreasestrongly with decreasing halo mass, to about 70% for Milky Way-sized halos. 5. For massive galaxies (

For massive galaxies ( M∗>1011M⊙), we predict that at least as much stellar mass is present in the ICL as in the galaxy itself out to intermediate redshifts, possibly as high as z∼1 for the largest clusters (although this dependsontheexactcutbetweenICLandgalaxystellar mass). 6.

Upturns in the stellar mass function at low stellar massesmeanthatdwarfgalaxies( M∗<108.5M⊙)havea higher stellar mass to halo mass ratio than that predicted by extrapolating results from more massive galaxies. The upturn is most robustly observed at low redshifts, but there are also indications at higher red- shifts for a steepening slope to the SM

We discusseffectsf rombotha distributioninstar formationratesforgalaxiesat a given halomassandfroma distributionofhalomassaccretionhist ories. Bimodality has been observed in the star formation rates of g alaxies at ﬁxed stellar mass, partially but not exclusively driven by quenched satellite galaxies (see, e.g., Wetzel et al. 201 2). This may appear to be a problem for our method becau

Remarkably,ho wever, our method is robust to any distribution of star formation ra tes in galaxies of the same stellar mass.

There is more possibility for error because we do not account for correlations between the star formation history (SFH) a nd the mass accretionhistory of a halo.

It is worth working through a more quantitative example to ve rify this assertion. Consider a population of galaxies all w ith the same stellar mass M∗= 1010M⊙today. Assume that each galaxy has had a constant SSFR for its entire lifetime (i.e., an exponential growth history), and moreover that the distrib ution of the SSFRs i
and moreover that the distrib ution of the SSFRs is log-normal with width 0.3 dex (similar t o that seen in Salim et al. 2007) and median 10−9yr−1. The average (as opposed to median) star formation rate for t his population is 12.7 M⊙yr−1; given the star formation histories just speciﬁed, this tra nslates into an average rate of change of stellar mass of 9.3M⊙yr−1over the next 100 Myr. If, on the other hand, we had simply assu med that all of the galaxies had star formation historiescorrespondin

Thus,weconcludethattheerrorsontheavera gequantities considered here introduced by lumping together star format ion histories for halos with different mass accretion histo ries are stronglysubdominantto existingobservationaluncertain ties. B.MERGINGGALAXIESAND MASS ACCRETION Because of passive stellar
AXIESAND MASS ACCRETION Because of passive stellar evolution, calculating the amou nt of stellar mass remaining in a galaxy (required for determ ining the star formation rate in Eq. 1), one must know the entire sta r formation history. For a large simulation, keeping track o f the individualstellarmasshistories(coveringhundredsofti mesteps)formillionsofgalaxiesrepeatedoverseveralmil lionrealizations of the stellar mass– halomass relationis inefﬁcient. Inste ad, since we are interestedin onlythe

Instead of keeping track of every halo/galaxy individually , we instead keep track of average star formation histories a t each timestep in bins of halo mass (which is a rank-3 tensor, SFHtf orm t,m;tis the time now, tf ormis the timestep at which the stellar mass was formed, and mis the halo mass). For central halos, we use the virial mass (a s discus
 central halos, we use the virial mass (a s discussed in §4); for satellite halos, we use the mass of the largest progenitor (the peak mass) in the s atellite’s mass accretion history. At every timestep, we ca lculate the number of halos that transition between one mass bin and a nother ( Tmp t,mn), i.e., the number of halos that had a mass mpat timestep tandamass mnattimestep t+1(seeAppendicesGandH).Similarly,wecalculatethemerge rratesforsubhalosateach timestepas afunctionof thesubhalopeakmassa

Keepingtrack of star formation histories then becomes an exercise in tens or multiplication, which is fast regardlessof the number of halos in thesimulation.

As discussed in §5.8, satellites at high redshifts ( z>1) tend to have short infall timescales, so they have roughly similar star formationhistoriesascentrals.

(B8) Note that the merging satellite ICL is not deposited into the central galaxy’s ICL, which is the same ap
nto the central galaxy’s ICL, which is the same approach taken by Conroyet al. (2007) and Purcellet al. (2007). Because the IC L of a merging satellite halo will get stripped long before th e stars in its associated galaxy, the stripped satellite’s IC L will end up in a much more extended, faint distribution than the host’s ICL. This formal speciﬁcation is equivalent to a discrete differ ential equation for the stellar mass history. It is thus impo rtant to properly specify the boundary conditio

This results in a change to the deﬁnition of κso that it no longer corresponds to an exact offset for active galaxy stellar masses; however , the correlati

At highredshif ts(e.g., z>6),the covariancewill bealmost perfect(1 dexrise in SFR p
covariancewill bealmost perfect(1 dexrise in SFR per 1 dex rise in stellar mass) because of the short times t hat galaxies have had to form stars. Between these two times, it is reasonable to assume that the covariance increases with i ncreasing redshift, so we adopt the following formula to int erpolate between z∼0and z/greaterorsimilar6: ρ(a)=1+(4ρ0.5−3.23)a+(2.46−4ρ0.5)a2.

Totest itscontinuedusefulness,we haveusedabundanc ematchingtoextracttheimpliedstellar mass–halomass(SM HM) relation from our low-redshift stellar mass functions (Mou stakaset al. 2013; Baldryet al. 2008). To account for the pre sence of scatter in observed stellar mass at ﬁxed halo mass, we use a method based on Richardson-Lucydeconvolution to extract t he medianstellar massasa functionofhalomass. We assumea com 
tellar massasa functionofhalomass. We assumea com binedscatterof0.2dex. The deconvolvedSMHM relation is shown in Fig. 20. The ﬁgure d emonstratesthat a doublepower-law can approximatethe relation, but can be discrepant by up to 0.1 dex. Adding one mo re parameter improves the ﬁt substantially, to a mean offset of less than 0.025 dex in our case. The discrepancies in the SM HM relation translate directly to discrepancies in the assu med stellar mass function. This may be seen in the right-hand pa

To test the high-redshift calibration of the mass function i n Tinkeret al. (2008), we integrate the mass function in two s imu- lations (Bolshoi and Consuelo) to 1011.5M⊙and compare to the Tinker mass function for the appropriate c osmology.

This discrepancy is due to the different initial conditi ons calculations used in the two simulations: Consuelo uses second-order Lagrangian Perturbation Theor y (2LPT), whereas Bolshoi and the Tinker MF use the Zel’dovic h approximation (1LPT). The Zel’dovich approximation has be en previously found to underestimate the

In terms of the satellite fraction, we determine ﬁts using a s imple, physically-motivated model. It is an oft-observed f eature of dark matter substructure that the number of satellite hal os at a given mass scales approximatelywith the mass of the ho st — the number d
oximatelywith the mass of the ho st — the number density of satellites in hosts of mass Mcis proportional to Mcφc(Mc), whereφc(M) is the mass function for central halos. Anotherfeatureof darkmattersubstructureis that t he numberof satellites at a givensatellite-to-hostmassra tio is largely self-similaracrosshosthalomasses; thisrequiresthatth eproportionalitymustscaleinverselywith thesatellitem ass.

For that reason, we use the slightly more ﬂexible form of Eq. G 6 and allow great freedom in the parametrization for both C(a) andMcutoff(a). Fitting the satellite fraction to a simulation is made espec ially tricky by the fact that simulations are incomplete for satellites at highermasses than for centralhalos, evenbeforeselecti ng satellites on MpeakorMac

For that reason, Consuelois unsuitable for determining the fraction of all but the most massive sate llites ( M∼1013M⊙), which provides an especially poor handle on constrainingtheredshiftevolutionoftheﬁt. Bolshoifare sbetter,beingcompleteforsatellitesdownto1011M⊙;yet,givenitsuse ofZAinitial conditions,it maynotseemespeciallysuitabl eforhigh-redshiftcalibration,either! Yet, there are two argumentsin its favor. First, the satelli te fraction is

Second,theinﬂuenceoftheinitialco nditionsonthe satellite fraction are largely through the effects of assem bly bias; however, recent work has shown that satellite rich ness (when tallied above a ﬁxed cut in accretion or peak mass) is almost u ncorrelatedwith formation time (Wu et al., in prep.).

Therefore,using the Bolshoi simulation,we ﬁt the satellit e fractionfrom z=0 to z=10; whensatellite masses aredetermined byMacc, weﬁnd: log10(C(a))=−2.69+11.68a−28.88a2+29.33a3−10.56a4(G7) log10(Mcutoff(a))=11.34+8.34a−0.36a2−5.08a3+0.75a4(G8) andﬁndthe followingparametrizationforthesatellite fra ctionwhensatellite massesaredeterminedby Mpeak: lo

H.HALO MASS ACCRETIONRATES The most commonly used ﬁtting formula for halo mass accretio n rates is that proposed by Wechsleret al. (2002), which suggests tha
posed by Wechsleret al. (2002), which suggests that halo mass growth is an exponential function in redshift ( M(z)∝exp(−cz)). As simulations improved, deviations from this simple formula were found, which led authors to pro pose more complicated formulas; e.g., M(z)∝(1+z)bexp(−cz) in McBrideet al. (2009). However, little attention has been given to the high-redshift behavior of these formulas, with the predictable result that they fail to accurately capture med ian mass accretion histories for h

Tomotivateourcho iceofimprovedﬁttingformulas,wenoteanissuewith allproposed ﬁtting formulas to date, which is their exponential depende nce at high redshifts. That is to say, the mass ratio of two hal osM1 andM2will asymptoteto M1(z) M2(z)→M1(0) M2(0)exp(( c2−c1)z) (H1) This is problematicbecause moremassive halosusually have steeper exponentialdependencies(i.e.

Using theMcBrideet al.(2009)formula,forexample,withtheMult iDarksimulation,weﬁndthatitpredictstheprogenitorsof 1015M⊙ halos to be less massive than the progenitorsof 1014.75M⊙halos as early as z=5.

We therefore parametrize the mass accretion history of a sin gle halo mass, and then parametrize the ratiosof progenitor masses forother halo masses, whichentirely avoidsthe prob lemof crossingprogenitormass histories.

We applied a semi-analytic spectral fitting approach to the data from different regions in the galaxies to derive several of their key physical properties. From the best-fit model results, together with direct observables such as morphology, colour, and the Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratio measured within 1 Re, w
d the Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratio measured within 1 Re, we find that for central galaxies both their stellar and halo masses have a significant influence in their evolution. For a given halo mass, galaxies with higher stellar mass accumulate their stellar mass and become chemically enriched earlier than those with smaller stellar mass. Furthermore, at a given stellar mass, galaxies living in more massive halos have longer star-formation timescales and are delayed in becoming chemically enriched. In con
re delayed in becoming chemically enriched. In contrast, the evolution of massive satellite galaxies is mostly determined by their stellar mass. The results indicate that both the assembled halo mass and the halo assembly history impact the evolution of central galaxies. Our spatially resolved analysis indicates that only the galaxy properties in the central region (0 .0–0.5Re) show the dependencies described above. This fact supports a halo-driven formation scenario since the galaxies’ central 
en formation scenario since the galaxies’ central regions are more likely to contain old stars formed along with the halo itself, keeping a memory of the halo formation process. Key words: galaxies: fundamental parameters – galaxies: stellar content –galaxies: formation – galaxies: evolution 1 INTRODUCTION In the current ΛCDM paradigm, galaxies form at the centre of dark matter halos (e.g. White & Rees 1978). It is thus perhaps unsurpris- ing that a galaxy’s evolution would correlate, to first-o
t a galaxy’s evolution would correlate, to first-order, with the growth of the dark matter halo (e.g. White & Rees 1978; Blumen- thal et al. 1984). The formation and evolution of dark matter halos are mainly driven by gravitational forces, which are relatively well understood through large N-body simulations (e.g. Springel et al. 2005). Yet, galaxies are complex systems not regulated by dark matter alone; they are also affected by a variety of baryonic pro- cesses. The physics involved in these 
ryonic pro- cesses. The physics involved in these processes is highly non-linear and remains to be fully understood. It is therefore very important to investigate, simultaneously, how the physical properties of galaxies and their evolution are driven by their dark matter halos (i.e., the galaxy-halo connection), together with their dependence on physi- cal properties connected with the baryonic physics.

It has long been known that galaxies in high-density regions such as groups and clusters are more likely to be red and dead (e.g. Oemler 1974; Dressler 1980; Postman & Geller 1984). More recent obser- vations through large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Su
ugh large surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Sur- vey (SDSS,York et al. 2000) have revealed that satellite galaxies in groups and clusters –especially the low-mass ones– can have their star-formation quenched by the dense environment (e.g. Pasquali et al. 2010; Peng et al. 2012; Wetzel et al. 2012, 2013). For massive galaxies, however, being a central or satellite galaxy does not seem to alter their evolution paths. The consensus from a number of re- cent investigations is that the stellar po
 of re- cent investigations is that the stellar populations of massive galaxies are largely determined by internal galaxy properties rather than the environment, which is related to the properties of their halos (e.g. Peng et al. 2012; Greene et al. 2015; Scott et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2022b). Results from large surveys such as SDSS also reveal that, of all the internal galaxy properties that may drive the evolution of massive galaxies, their stellar mass and/or central velocity disper- sion are

Such a ratio can serve as a proxy for the timescale of the galaxies’ star for- mation: a galaxy with an early truncated star formation history will end up with enhanced [ α/Fe] ratio compared to galaxies with more extended star formation histories (Worthey 1994; Thomas et al. 2005). In this sense, galaxies of higher present-day stellar masses have built up their stella
sent-day stellar masses have built up their stellar mass faster than lower-mass ones; this so- called ‘downsizing’ phenomenon provides important constraints to galaxy formation models. However, it remains a puzzle whether ‘downsizing’ is solely driven by the stellar mass of the galaxies, or if it is a reflection of the different assembly histories of their dark matter halos. Scholz- Díaz et al. (2022) addressed the question by analyzing a sample of nearby central galaxies from SDSS and investiga
of nearby central galaxies from SDSS and investigating the cor- relation between their stellar population properties and the prop- erties of their host halos. They found that the ages and metallici- ties of galaxies are not fully determined by stellar mass – at fixed stellar mass, the halo mass plays a secondary yet noticeable role so that galaxies in more massive halos tend to be younger and more metal-poor. Similar conclusions are reached by the work of Oyarzún et al. (2022), in which IFU data

(2022), in which IFU data from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey are used to assert the influence of halo mass on stellar populations of pas- sive central galaxies. From simulations, Wang et al. (2023) find that central galaxies in more massive halos have lower gas-phase metallicity at high redshift than those in low-mass halos due to the long-lasting accretion of low-metallicity gas. Such an effect is used to explain the low metallic
Such an effect is used to explain the low metallicity of cluster galaxies found at high red- shift (e.g. Wang et al. 2022). These studies open a new window to investigating how the properties of dark matter halos can impact the evolution of galaxies. However, most of these studies are based on simple age or metallicity averages and are limited to single-fibre observation or specific types of galaxies. A full description of the spatially resolved past history of a large and well-defined sample of
past history of a large and well-defined sample of galaxies will provide key information on how galaxy halo and stellar masses shaped their evolution. Fortunately, we are now in a position to investigate these phys- ical processes in more detail. In recent work (Zhou et al. 2022a, hereafter Paper I), we have shown that it is possible to go beyond the simple averaged age/metallicity to reach a full description of the stellar mass accumulation and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies using a

This approach fits chemical evolution models directly to the spectra to determine physical parameters that characterise the timescales of star formation and the rates of gas accretion and loss, which can be more fundamentally related to the formation and evolution of the galaxies within their dark matter halos.

A survey (Bundy et al. 2015) provides high- quality spatially resolved spectra for a well-defined sample of over 10,000 galaxies. The large sample size allows us to apply differ- ent grouping strategies to separate the effects from stellar mass and halo mass, while the spatially resolved power of MaNGA helps to pin down the effect on different regions, which may reflect various physical processes.

ble from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey. In this section, we give a brief introduc- tion to the survey and then describe our sample selection and data reduction processes. 2.1 MaNGA MaNGA was part of the fourth generation of SDSS (SDSS-IV , Blanton et al. 2017). This survey provided spatially-resolved high- quality spectroscopy data for over 10,000 nearby (redshift 0 .01< z<0.15) galaxies (Yan et al. 2016b), covering the stellar mass range 5 ×108h−2M⊙⩽M∗⩽3×1011h−2M⊙(Wake et al. 2017).

The spectra were obtained with the two dual-channel BOSS spectrographs (Smee et al. 2013) mounted on the Sloan 2.5 m telescope (Gunn et al. 2006), covering 3600−10300Å in wavelength with intermediate spectral resolu- tion ( R∼2000, Drory et al. 2015). MaNGA used a Data Reduction Pipeline (DRP; Law et al. 2016) to produce science-ready spectra with flux calibration 
oduce science-ready spectra with flux calibration better than 5% across most of the wavelength range (Yan et al. 2016a). In addition, a Data Analysis Pipeline (DAP;Westfall et al. 2019; Belfiore et al. 2019) was used to process these reduced data, providing various useful data products includ- ing stellar kinematics, emission-line properties and spectral indices. Moreover, the MaNGA collaboration has carried out very exten- sive analysis and research with the data, and some of the outputs of tha
arch with the data, and some of the outputs of that work have been released as value-added-catalogues (V ACs); we will make use of a number of these results in this paper. 2.2 Sample selection and data preparation We start from the parent sample of disk galaxies defined in Pa- per I. This parent sample consists of 2560 galaxies selected from the MaNGA survey. In a previous paper (Zhou et al. 2022b) we explored explicitly how the evolution of low-mass galaxies is af- fected by the environment. We

To obtain the group properties of these galaxies, we cross-match this sam- ple with the group catalogue of Yang et al. (2007), from which we identify massive central and satellite galaxies, as well as the group halo masses of these galaxies. To avoid the most extreme environmental effects, we limit our investigation to galaxies in groups and not clusters. H

After this selection, we end up with a sample of 972 massive central disk galaxies and 113 massive satellites.

m Tinker (2021). Discussing the differences between alternative group catalogues goes beyond the scope of this work. However, as a consistency check, we have performed a similar analysis to the one described below using the group catalogue from Tinker (2021) and find gen- erally the same results as the ones using the Yang et al. (2007) catalogue. Similar analysis carried out by Oyarzún et al. (2022) also indicates that the results of their analysis were robust against group catalogue choice. We 
is were robust against group catalogue choice. We thus decided to use the catalogue from Yang et al. (2007) throughout this paper to facilitate comparisons with previous published work. In what follows we will focus on the sample constructed above to discuss the effect of stellar mass and halo mass on the evolution of galaxies. As mentioned above, observational data for our sample galax- ies comes from the MaNGA survey. The raw data cubes provided by the MaNGA DRP contain spectra for individual 
d by the MaNGA DRP contain spectra for individual spaxels with typical signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) in the r-band∼4–8 Å−1at the outskirts of galaxies (Law et al. 2016), which is not sufficient for robust stellar-population (specially metallicity) analysis. We thus stack spaxels to obtain spectra with the required SNR. In this work, we intend to investigate both the global and spatially-resolved prop- erties of the galaxies. To this end, we perform two types of stacking. For the global properties
m two types of stacking. For the global properties, we use all the spaxels within 1 Re, with Rebeing the effective radius of each galaxy. This achieves sufficient SNR to calculate the galaxies’ integrated properties with a high de- gree of confidence. To investigate the stellar population properties in a spatially-resolve way, we need to reach a compromise between the required SNR and spatial resolution. This is achieved by divid- ing each galaxy into two regions: an inner region within 0 .5Re, 
 into two regions: an inner region within 0 .5Re, and and outer region from 0 .5Reto 1.5Re, stacking the spaxels within each radial range. The stacking procedure is similar to the one used inZhou et al. (2019). The spectra of individual spaxels are shifted to the rest frame using the stellar kinematics information provided by the MaNGA DAP. The rest-frame spectra are then co-added to- gether to obtain a single spectrum with high SNR. Note that adja- cent spaxels from MaNGA datacubes are not full
ja- cent spaxels from MaNGA datacubes are not fully independent; we therefore correct for co-variance between spaxels using the correc- tion term from Westfall et al. (2019). The stacking procedure yields spectra with a typical SNR (averaged over all wavelengths) of ∼70per Å for the 1 Restacks, and ∼50 per Å for the inner and outer regions. Such SNRs are suitable to derive reliable star-formation histories (SFHs) and chemical evolution histories (ChEHs) for the galaxies (Zhou et al. 2022a). Havi
(ChEHs) for the galaxies (Zhou et al. 2022a). Having obtained integrated spectra for the regions defined above, we derive some galaxy properties directly from the emis- sion lines. These properties will provide additional constraints to our model. Firstly, we derive the current star-formation rate (SFR) of the relevant regions. This is achieved by obtaining the H αflux measurements of every individual spaxel from the MaNGA DAP. DAP models simultaneously the continuum and emission lines for each 
neously the continuum and emission lines for each MaNGA spectrum, providing continuum-subtracted emission line fluxes of various emission lines. For the H αflux, we correct for dust attenuation using the Balmer decrement assuming an intrinsic Hα/Hβratio of 2.87 (Osterbrock & Ferland 2006). Dust-corrected Hαfluxes from all spaxels in each region are coadded to derive the total H αflux and luminosity. This is then used to calculate the SFR following the calibration of Murphy et al. (2011) assuming
g the calibration of Murphy et al. (2011) assuming a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF): SFR(M⊙yr−1) =5.37×10−42LHα(erg s−1). (1) In addition to the SFR, we estimate the gas-phase metallic- ity of each region to provide further constraints to our models. To this end, we obtain measurements of four emission lines, i.e., [OIII]λ5007, [N II]λ6584, H α, and H βfor every spaxel of the galaxy from the MaNGA DAP. We then use the O3N2 indicator with the calibration of Pettini & Pagel (2004) to 
with the calibration of Pettini & Pagel (2004) to estimate the gas- phase metallicity of each spaxel. The value for each region is ob- tained from the median of the corresponding spaxels. To facilitate the comparison between metallicities calculated from the chem- ical evolution model and the gas emission lines, we normalized all the gas-phase metallicities to the solar oxygen abundance. We use a solar metallicity of 0 .02 and a solar oxygen abundance of 12+log(O/H) =8.83 (Anders & Grevesse 1989
dance of 12+log(O/H) =8.83 (Anders & Grevesse 1989). These values are adopted for consistency with the settings of the Bruzual & Char- lot (2003) SSP model used throughout this work (see Section 3.2). Obviously, caution is urged when comparing with results obtained with alternative calibrations. 3 ANALYSIS The observational data, including the stacked spectra, SFR, and gas-phase metallicities are modelled using a semi-analytic spectral fit- ting approach. This approach introduces a simple but fl
approach. This approach introduces a simple but flexible chemical evolution model to characterise the stellar mass accumu- lation and chemical evolution history of galaxies, which are com- bined with stellar population synthesis to produce model spectra that can be directly compared with observations. The model catches the main physical processes involved in galaxy evolution, and it is designed to be simple but flexible enough to produce model spectra that fit most kinds of galaxies. More detail
ectra that fit most kinds of galaxies. More details on the model and the tests performed to validate it can be found in Paper I. Here we will just briefly introduce the main ingredients of the approach. 3.1 The chemical evolution model In the general picture, the main physics governing the star forma- tion and chemical evolution of a galaxy includes gas inflow and outflow, as well as the star formation and chemical enrichment pro- cess that happens within the resulting gas reservoir. Taking into

Zhou account all these processes, the gas mass evolution of a galaxy can be modelled with the following equation: ˙Mg(t) = ˙Min(t)−ψ(t)+˙Mre(t)−˙Mout(t). (2) The first term on the right-hand side represents how the gas falls into the galaxy. Such a process is often modelled with an exponen- tially decaying function ˙Min(t) =Ae−(t−t0)/τ,t>t0. (3) The second and third terms characterise the gas lost due to star for- mat
rms characterise the gas lost due to star for- mation and returned from dying stars respectively, while the final term represents the gas outflow process. The star formation activ- ity can be modelled with a linear Schmidt law (Schmidt 1959) that reads ψ(t) =S×Mg(t), (4) with Sbeing the star-formation efficiency. We estimate this ef- ficiency using the extended Schmidt law proposed by Shi et al. (2011), S(yr−1) =10−10.28±0.08Σ∗ M⊙pc−20.48 , (5) where Σ∗is the stellar mass surface density. For 
 where Σ∗is the stellar mass surface density. For the investigation of global properties of the galaxy, we obtain an approximate Σ∗ using its current stellar mass and effective radius from the NSA so that Σ∗=0.5×M∗/(πR2e). For the inner (0–0.5 Re) and outer (0.5–1.5 Re) regions, we make use of the stellar mass map of each galaxy obtained from the pip3D value-added catalogue to calculate the stellar mass in each region and derive their average Σ∗. The return of gas from dying stars is modelled wi
 The return of gas from dying stars is modelled with a simple constant mass return fraction of R=0.3, which means 30% of the stellar mass formed in each generation will be returned to the ISM. This return is assumed to happen instantaneously when the stellar population is formed. The outflow term is traditionally modelled to have the outflow strength proportional to the star formation activity: ˙Mout(t) =λψ(t), (6) with a dimensionless quantity λbeing the so-called ‘wind parame- ter’. In this wo
being the so-called ‘wind parame- ter’. In this work, following paper I, we allow the wind parameter to vary with time by simply turning it off at a time tcut, which is a free parameter during the fitting. This cutoff represents when a galaxy’s potential well becames too deep for the winds to escape and it allows a secondary star-formation episode during the evolu- tion of the galaxy which provides additional flexibility in matching observations. Under all these assumptions, we derive the final 
 Under all these assumptions, we derive the final equa- tion that characterises the gas mass evolution as ˙Mg(t) =Ae−(t−t0)/τ−S(1−R+λ)Mg(t)(fort<tcut) Ae−(t−t0)/τ−S(1−R)Mg(t) (fort>tcut).(7) We now turn to the metallicity evolution of this gas compo- nent. Throughout this work, we adopt an instantaneous mixing ap- proximation, which assumes that the gas in a galaxy is always well mixed during its evolution. In this case, the equations governing the chemical evolution can be written down as ˙MZ(
the chemical evolution can be written down as ˙MZ(t) =Zin˙Min(t)−Zg(t)(1−R)SMg(t)+yZ(1−R)SMg(t) −Zg(t)λSMg(t),(8) and ˙MZ(t) =Zin˙Min(t)−Zg(t)(1−R)SMg(t)+yZ(1−R)SMg(t),(9)Table 1.

The effect of the inflow is described by the first term, in which gas with an initial metallicity Zinis falling into the system. It is often assumed that the infall gas is pristine so we always set Zin=0. The second term represents the gas mass locked up in long-lived stars, while the third term describes how the chem

A free parameter yZis adopted to characterise the fraction of metal mass generated per stellar mass. Finally, the last term in Equation 8 is the outflow term, representing the removal of metal-enriched gas. 3.2 Spectral fitting approach We explore the parameter space of the model described above to find a solution that matches the observations best. Such a fitting process is done through a Ba
 best. Such a fitting process is done through a Bayesian approach. In short, we first generate a set of model parameters from a prior distribution listed in Table 1. Parameters related to the chemical evolution model are then used to predict corresponding star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution history (ChEH) following Equation 7, Equa- tion 8 and Equation 9. We calculate a model spectrum from the predicted SFH and chemical following the standard stellar popu- lation synthesis proced
the standard stellar popu- lation synthesis procedure (see Conroy 2013 for a review). Dur- ing the calculation, we use single stellar population (SSP) mod- els from Bruzual & Charlot (2003) constructed using the STILIB empirical stellar spectra templates (Le Borgne et al. 2003) with a Chabrier IMF (Chabrier 2003). The SSP model spectra cover the range 3200–9500Å with a high spectral resolution of 3Å and are available for metallicity values Zfrom 0.0001 to 0.05 and ages from 0.0001Gyr to 20Gyr, w
0.0001 to 0.05 and ages from 0.0001Gyr to 20Gyr, which are suitable for fitting MaNGA galax- ies. We broaden the SSP templates to account for the broadening due to stellar velocity dispersion and instrumental effects in the ob- served spectra, which is inferred from an initial pPXF Cappellari (2017) fit to the spectra. During this initial fit, emission lines in the observed spectra are identified and masked out in the subsequent analysis. Regarding dust attenuation, we simply use a screen dust m

quent analysis. 4 RESULT AND DISCUSSION Having obtained the best-fit galaxy properties for the galaxies, we are now in a position to investigate how the halo mass and stellar mass affect their evolution, including the galaxies’ star formation and chemical enrichment histories. 4.1 Global properties We start by exploring the global properties of each galaxy, obtained by fitting the observed data stacked within 1 Re. To separate the effects from halo mass and stellar mass, we divide the sample int
lo mass and stellar mass, we divide the sample into small ranges of one property and see whether the other property has a significant impact on the evolution of these galaxies. 4.1.1 The effect of stellar mass at fixed halo mass We first focus on the effect of the stellar mass of the galaxies, which has been known to be the main driver of the variation in the the galaxies’ properties and evolution. As revealed by many pre- vious investigations, galaxies generally follow a so-called ‘down- sizing
alaxies generally follow a so-called ‘down- sizing’ formation scenario – more massive galaxies tend to accumu- late their stellar masses and become chemical-enriched earlier than galaxies of lower stellar masses (e.g. Kauffmann et al. 2003; Gal- lazzi et al. 2005; Thomas et al. 2005). It is thus interesting to know whether such an effect holds when the halo mass of the galaxy is controlled for. To achieve this, we perform a linear fit to the stellar mass–halo mass relation (shown as dash lines i
lar mass–halo mass relation (shown as dash lines in the left panels of Figure 2). Note that in this plot we only include the sample of cen- tral galaxies, so that the halo mass can be regarded as the mass of the galaxies’ own halo. At a given halo mass, galaxies that fall above the relation (de- noted as high M∗galaxies) are relatively more massive (in stars) than those that fall below the relation (denoted as low M∗galax- ies). We then obtain the averaged chemical enrichment history and stellar
e averaged chemical enrichment history and stellar mass accumulation history of galaxies in the two categories and compare them with each other in Figure 2. In the upper panels of Figure 2, we focus on galaxies with halo masses in the range of 1011.5M⊙⩽Mh⩽1012.5M⊙. It is clear that high M∗galax- ies (red) become chemically enriched systematically earlier than lowM∗galaxies (blue), even when they reside in halos of similar masses. Especially, high M∗galaxies tend to build up their metal content v
 M∗galaxies tend to build up their metal content very quickly in the first several Gyrs and then evolve slowly with time. On the other hand, the chemical enrichment processes of low M∗galaxies tend to be suppressed at the beginning but then experience a secondary increase in the last few Gyrs. From the re- sults of paper I and those of an earlier investigation of galaxies at z∼0.7 selected from the LEGA-C survey (Zhou et al. 2024), this kind of evolution may be be the consequence of AGN activity
volution may be be the consequence of AGN activity in the galaxies. Correspondingly, we see that high M∗galaxies also tend to finish their star formation process earlier – a larger fractionof stars in low M∗galaxies form in the last 5Gyrs, which leads to the recent increase in their metal content. Similar results can be found in the lower panels of Fig- ure 3, where we focus on galaxies living in more massive halos (1012.5M⊙⩽Mh⩽1013.5M⊙), but the differences between the low- and high- M∗categori
 differences between the low- and high- M∗categories appear smaller. This result is very much consistent with, and reinforces, the long-established ‘down-sizing’ paradigm. What is new here is that our results show that ‘down-sizing’ still exists even if we control for halo masses; in other words, we conclude that ‘down-sizing’ is not solely driven by halo mass evolution, but some internal baryonic process – linked with stellar mass – also play a role. Similar conclusions were reached by Scholz-D
role. Similar conclusions were reached by Scholz-Díaz et al. (2022) and Oyarzún et al. (2022) using average age and metallicities. How- ever, our work provides a more detailed picture by obtaining the full history of the galaxies, showing that the different evolution be- tween massive galaxies in the high and low M∗categories can be traced back to more than 12Gyrs ago. Note that Oyarzún et al. (2022) investigated mainly passive galaxies, whose star formation activity has been fully quenched for 
ar formation activity has been fully quenched for several Gyrs. In their results, the difference between the stellar pop- ulation properties in high and low M∗galaxies would have been in- printed by the star formation taking place at very early epochs in their evolution. Our work, centred on disk galaxies, complements that of Oyarzún et al. (2022). Both pieces of research find simi- lar differences in the early evolution of high- and low- M∗galaxies which apply equally to present-day passive and
ies which apply equally to present-day passive and disk galaxies. This suggests that the physics driving the evolution of these galaxies has been at play since very early times. We will come back to this point and discuss it in more detail in Section 4.3.2. 4.1.2 The effect of halo mass at fixed stellar mass We now move on to see whether the halo mass has an impact on the galaxies’ evolution when the stellar mass is controlled for. In parallel to what we did before, we now perform a linear fit t
 what we did before, we now perform a linear fit to the halo mass–stellar mass relation, and use the relation to divide our galaxy sample into high and low halo-mass ( Mh) galaxies by select- ing those who fall above and below the mean relation respectively. In the upper panels of Figure 3, we compare galaxies in the stellar mass range 1010.4M⊙⩽M∗⩽1010.8M⊙but with different halo masses. It is intriguing to see that galaxies seem to know how massive their halo is – at fixed stellar mass a galaxy 
ve their halo is – at fixed stellar mass a galaxy residing in a more massive halo tends to become chemically enriched later than those residing in lower-mass halos. High Mhgalaxies also tend to have more recent star formation, as indicated by their later mass accumulation (right panel). Again, the results obtained from our complete star-formation and chemical enrichment histories echo the findings from averaged ages and metallicities presented in Scholz-Díaz et al. (2022) and Oyarzún et al. (202
 Scholz-Díaz et al. (2022) and Oyarzún et al. (2022). Similar results hold for more massive galaxies (1010.8M⊙⩽ M∗⩽1011.2M⊙) as shown in the lower panels of Figure 3. In these more massive galaxies, the differences in metal enrichment histo- ries between the high- and low- Mhgalaxies also become smaller. In addition, there is a hint in the SFH that high Mhgalaxies may have formed their stars earlier than low Mhones. Such effect can also be seen for massive passive galaxies in Oyarzún et al. (202
or massive passive galaxies in Oyarzún et al. (2022), who found that the most massive ( M∗>1011M⊙) passive central galax- ies in more massive halos can be older (albeit more metal-poor) than those in less massive halos.

3 Empirical evidence The intriguing influence of stellar mass and halo mass on the evolu- tion of galaxies described above is derived from our best-fit model results. To avoid possible model-dependent biases, we explore now alternative empirical evidence as a model-independent check. In Figure 4 we investigate the distribution of morphological type (left), NUV−rcolour (middle), and Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratio (right) on the stellar mass–halo mass plane. On the left panel, the morphology of a galaxy is 
 On the left panel, the morphology of a galaxy is indicated by its T-type, with T- type⩽0 for early-type galaxies, T-type >0 for late-type galaxies, and T-type =0 for S0s. These T-types are obtained from one of the SDSS value-added catalogues (V AC), the MaNGA Morphology Deep Learning DR17 Catalogue (Domínguez Sánchez et al. 2022), in which a Deep Learning approach is applied to all MaNGA galax- ies to determine their morphology. We see a trend that seems to go perpendicular to the stellar mass–
hat seems to go perpendicular to the stellar mass–halo mass relation: galaxies that fall above the relation tend to have earlier morphologies. It is well known that galaxies with early morphological types tend to form their stars and quench their starf formation earlier than late-type galaxies, so it is not surprising to see the different evolu- tionary paths of galaxies in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Such a trend is also seen clearly in the middle panel, in which the distribution of NUV−rcolour, a g
nel, in which the distribution of NUV−rcolour, a good indicator of recent star formation activity, is shown. Star-forming galaxies tend to have NUV−r<4, while quenched galaxies often have NUV−r>4. Galaxies that fall above the stellar mass–halo mass relation have lower recent star formationactivity, which matches the expectations from their morphologies, as shown on the left panel. The right panel of Figure 4 shows the Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratio, an indicator of the star-formation timescale. The Mgb in

The Fe5270 and Fe5335 indices correlate with the abundance of iron, which is pro- duced in both type Ia and core-collapse supernovae (Nomoto et al. 1984). Since core-collapse supernovae explode very soon after star formation, while the progenitors of type Ia supernovae are rela- tively low-mass stars and therefore need a longer
 tively low-mass stars and therefore need a longer time to evolve, stellar populations formed in a short time-scale tend to have en- hanced α-element abundances, indicated by higher Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩val- ues. This is because their ISM had not been polluted by type Ia su- pernova explosions by the time they stopped forming stars (Thomas et al. 2005). Galaxies located above the stellar mass–halo mass re- lation tend to have shorter star-formation timescales, as indicated by their higher Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩values. T

This empirical observation is in excellent qualitative agreement with the results obtained from the best-fit SFHs shown in the right panels of Figure 2 and Figure 3. Alternative explanations have been proposed for the varia- tion of the Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratio not directly related to the star- formation timescale. One of them is that galaxies with a shallower IMF slope at the high-mass end would show an enhancement in Mg, as there would be more massi
an enhancement in Mg, as there would be more massive stars that can release Mg to the ISM. In this scenario, our findings indicate that more mas- sive galaxies hold a shallower IMF slope at the high-mass end.

However, it is somehow in conflict with some recent investigations of the IMF in galaxies – at the low-mass end, studies based on either kinemat- ics (e.g. Cappellari et al. 2012; Li et al. 2017) or small absorption features (e.g. van Dokkum & Conroy 2012; Martín-Navarro et al. 2015; Zhou et al. 2019) in the spectra favor a bot

At the high-mass end, analysis on Wolf- Rayet stars also indicates a steeper slope in more massive or metal- rich galaxies (Liang et al. 2021). A possible scenario that accom- modates all the available observational evidence has recently been proposed by den Brok et al. (2024), who speculate that the high-mass end IMF slope is representative of the very early age of the galaxies, and the low-mass end slope 
y age of the galaxies, and the low-mass end slope of the later star formation. In our current work, however, we are not able to explore the variation of IMF in our model due to the limited data quality. In what fol- lows we will stick to the widely-accepted interpretation that the en- hancement in Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩orαelement abundance indicates shorter ster-formation timescales. In our fitting process, we use a stellar population model with fixed solar abundance patterns. In this case, the variation of 
bundance patterns. In this case, the variation of the Mg and Fe indices themselves due to the changes of αabundance in the galaxies are not expected to affect the fitting results. However, we are able to investigate the effect of such variations in an indi- rect way – in our model, the infall timescale of the gas is the main MNRAS 000, 1–13 (2022) 8 S.

To check this we use Figure 5, which is sim- ilar to the right panel of Figure 4 but now colour-coding galaxies by the best-fit gas infall timescale instead of Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩.

All the consistent results we have found following different approaches support the scenario that both the total mass assembled andthe timescale of the mass assembly process have a significant impact on how a galaxy formed and evolved. We will come back to this point and discuss it in more detail in Section 4.3. 4.1.4 The influence of halo mass on the evolution of satellite galaxies As a comparison, we also check whether the halo mass has a sig- nificant impact on the evolution of
ass has a sig- nificant impact on the evolution of massive satellite galaxies. Note that, for satellite galaxies, the halo mass here is the mass of the group/cluster halo they inhabit instead of the individual halo of the galaxy itself. In the top panels of Figure 6, we divide the satellite sample into high Mhand low Mhgalaxies following a similar ap- proach to that used in Figure 3. Contrary to what we found for cen- tral galaxies, we do not observe any difference between the high- and low- Mhs
erve any difference between the high- and low- Mhsamples, indicating that the group halo mass has little impact on the evolution of these massive satellite galaxies. Con- versely, in the bottom panels of Figure 6 we control for the group halo mass and divide our sample into high M∗and low M∗galax- ies, from which we see that the stellar mass still plays some role in shaping the evolution of the galaxies, although the impact is small due to the coarseness of the division and the relatively small 
arseness of the division and the relatively small sample size. This result is not surprising since it is well known that the influence of the group/cluster environment on satellites is mostlylimited to low-mass galaxies (e.g. Pasquali et al. 2010; Wetzel et al. 2012; Peng et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2022b). For the relatively high mass galaxies in our sample, their potential wells are often deep enough to protect the gas in the galaxies from being stripped out by the environment, and the environmen
tripped out by the environment, and the environmental effect is therefore weaker. Given the results, in what follows we will only focus on the cen- tral disk galaxies in our sample and try to figure out the possible physical drivers of the observed trends. 4.2 Additional evidence from spatially-resolved results From the global properties analysied above, we have learned that both halo mass and stellar mass have an impact on the evolution of central disk galaxies, while for satellite disk galaxie
al disk galaxies, while for satellite disk galaxies only the stel- lar mass of the galaxy plays a role. From our best-fit models, the im- pact is very likely to act by changing the gas infall timescale of the galaxy. If this scenario is correct, we may naturally expect that such a mechanism leaves footprints mainly at the centre of the galaxy. The reason for such expectation is simple: current galaxy formation models suggest that these massive halos mainly grow through ma- jor mergers that happe
los mainly grow through ma- jor mergers that happened mostly before z∼2 and the majority of the stars in the centre of the galaxies often formed during the vio- lent gas infall and star formation triggered by such events (e.g. Mo et al. 1998). In contrast, the outer parts of the galaxy, especially the outer disk, often formed through long-timescale secular evolution processes or minor mergers, which would not be expected to retain much memory of the halo formation or the gas infall histories of 
the halo formation or the gas infall histories of the galaxy a long time ago. The spatially-resolved information provided by MaNGA gives us a great opportunity to test such a scenario. In this section, we fo- cus on how the evolution of central galaxies can be affected by the halo mass and stellar mass in a spatially resolved way. Specifically, we divide each galaxy into inner (0.0–0.5 Re) and outer (0.5–1.5 Re) regions, and investigate the distributions of the resolved galaxy properties on the 
ibutions of the resolved galaxy properties on the stellar mass–halo mass plane. In the first row of Figure 7, we show the distribution of Mgb/⟨Fe⟩on the stellar mass-halo mass plane for the central (left panel) and outer (panel in the middle) regions respectively, and in the right panel we show the difference between values in the two regions. We see that Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩shows a trend in the central region that is similar to that found for the global values (shown in the right panel of Figure 4): galax
lues (shown in the right panel of Figure 4): galaxies that lie above the stellar mass–halo mass relation tend to have higher Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩. As discussed above, this higher Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩indicates shorter star formation timescales, which may linked to faster assembly of their gas content. In con- trast, in the outer regions (middle panel) we do not observe a sim- ilar trend; the outer regions of more massive galaxies tend to have higher Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩values, but these show no correlation with the halo mass. Th
t these show no correlation with the halo mass. This result suggests that the outer region of a galaxy is not “aware” of the mass of the halo. The difference between the Mgb/⟨Fe⟩values in the inner and outer regions (i.e., the radial gra- dient) is shown on the right panel; no clear trend is found there either. Such a result is consistent with the proposed scenario, con- firming that it is the evolution of the central region of the galaxy which is affected by both the stellar mass and the halo m
s affected by both the stellar mass and the halo mass of the galaxy. We further test such a scenario using our semi-analytic spec- tral fitting approach. We apply our models to data stacked within the inner and outer regions of the galaxies (see Section 2). From the best-fit parameters, we obtain the best-fit star formation and chemical evolution histories for the two regions in each galaxy.

Similar to the top panels, we see an even clearer trend in the central region of the galaxy (left), and the absence of the correlation for the outer re- gion (middle) and the gradients (right). Similarly, in the third row of Figure 7 we present a plot for t50,Z, which is defined as the time when the region’s metallicity reaches half of its present-day value. We see very similar trends in t50,Z: in the central region of the galaxies t50,Zshows a systematic trend perpendicular to the stel- lar mas
ystematic trend perpendicular to the stel- lar mass–halo mass relation, while in the outer regions, the trend becomes much weaker. Such a result indicates again that the gas infall timescale or halo formation process leave footprints mainly in the central region of the galaxies. We end the discussion by comparing our spatially-resolved re- sults with those of previous works. Scholz-Díaz et al. (2022) use single-fibre SDSS spectra to investigate the scatter of galaxy prop- erties across the stell
he scatter of galaxy prop- erties across the stellar-to-halo mass relation. Although they only consider averaged ages and metallicities, their results are very sim- ilar to the ones we find from the spectra stacked within 1 Reor the central 0 .5Re. Considering the 3 arcsecond SDSS fibre diameter, the galaxy properties they obtained are mostly from the central re- gions, so it is not surprising to find consistent results for the cen- tre of the galaxies. Such a good agreement between different ap
laxies. Such a good agreement between different ap- proaches and datasets gives us further confidence that we are cap- turing some real physics. Oyarzún et al. (2022) use similar IFU data from MaNGA toexplore how stellar populations depend on stellar and halo mass for passive central galaxies. They report that at fixed stellar mass, the evolution of these galaxies has a significant dependence on the halo mass, and the dependence holds until 1 .5Re. At first glance, their spatially resolved resul
e. At first glance, their spatially resolved results seem to be inconsistent with what we find for the outskirts of the galaxies. However, their sample contains only passive galaxies, which means that their star formation activity was already quenched several Gyrs ago. Without being polluted by the stellar populations formed recently, which do not have memory of the halo formation in the distant past, it can be expected that the record of the halo formation can be found in these passive galaxies
o formation can be found in these passive galaxies at all radii. In fact, both results support the idea that it is the stellar populations formed in the early universe that “know” the properties of the dark matter halo. In what follows, we will discuss in detail the possible physical origin of the trends we have observed. 4.3 Possible physical origin of the observed trends 4.3.1 The effect of halo mass on the evolution of central galaxies In the current galaxy formation paradigm, galaxies form a
current galaxy formation paradigm, galaxies form at the cen- tre of dark matter halos, so their evolution ought to be deeply af- fected by the growth and evolution of the dark matter halos them- selves. It has thus long been proposed that, as the main parameter that determines the evolution of a dark matter halo, its mass may also drive the growth and evolution of the galaxy at its centre (e.g. White & Rees 1978; Blumenthal et al. 1984; Mo et al. 1998).

similar stellar mass, those with higher halo masses tend to be late in their chemical enrichment and thus have lower averaged stellar metallic- ity, and they also have more recent star formation activity. There are several possible physical processes that may be causing such trends. A natural explanation is that, at fixed stellar mass, more massive halos are more efficient at feeding gas into their central galaxy. The infalling pristine gas can dilute the ISM in the central galaxy, making it mor
ilute the ISM in the central galaxy, making it more metal-poor than that of galaxies in less massive halos. In addition, the long-lasting gas infall provides material for more recent star formation. Such a scenario is sup- ported by simulations. Wang et al. (2023) found from the EAGLE simulations that, at a given stellar mass, the ISM fraction of central galaxies in more massive dark matter halos at high redshift is gener- ally higher than that in less massive ones. Our best-fit model results su
n less massive ones. Our best-fit model results suggest longer gas-infall timescales in high Mhgalaxies, which is also evidence of more efficient gas accretion. Alternatively, it is thought that in these massive galaxies AGNfeedback can play an important role (e.g. Croton et al. 2006; Sijacki et al. 2007) in shaping their evolution. Strong AGN feedback can remove metal-enriched gas from the galaxy and suppress its chem- ical enrichment. Therefore, it is also possible that the halo proper- ties c
, it is also possible that the halo proper- ties correlate with the activity of the central black hole at a given stellar mass so that this connection can shape the evolution of the galaxy through feedback mechanisms. From the EAGLE simula- tions, Wang et al. (2023) did find that, at a given stellar mass, cen- tral galaxies in more massive dark matter halos tend to have high black hole masses, which they speculate it may be another mecha- nism for halos to affect the stellar population propertie
r halos to affect the stellar population properties of galaxies. However, using a variety of observational evidence, Kormendy & Ho (2013) conclude that the halo mass of a galaxy is not likely to be more fundamentally correlated with the central black hole mass than stellar mass. In this case, it is still in doubt whether the halo shapes the evolution of the galaxy by altering the properties and activity of the central supermassive black hole.

At a given halo mass, galaxies with higher stellar masses tend to be more metal-rich and host older stellar populations. However, in the current galaxy formation framework, a gal
, in the current galaxy formation framework, a galaxy’s growth history ought to be ultimately tied to the formation and evolution of its dark matter halo. In that case, other halo parameters beyond its mass Mh(especially those which correlate with the stellar mass of the galaxy), should have played an important role. However, it is often hard to infer the properties of dark matter halos beyond their mass, nor to correlate them with stellar population properties such as age and metallicity, as da
tion properties such as age and metallicity, as dark matter halos can not be observed directly. In these circumstances, people often seek solutions using semi-analytic models or hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy for- mation and evolution, trying to find other halo properties that may possibly be linked to the galaxies’ stellar populations. Promising progress along these lines has been made by Croton et al. (2007), who found from semi-analytic models that the halo formation time correlates with 
dels that the halo formation time correlates with galaxy luminosity at fixed halo mass. Since then, various hydrodynamic simulations and other semi-analytical mod- els have confirmed that, at fixed halo mass, earlier-formed halos host more massive galaxies than later-formed ones (e.g. Wang et al. 2013; Zehavi et al. 2018; Martizzi et al. 2020). We can thus spec- ulate that our findings of a dependence of the galaxy properties on stellar mass at fixed halo mass may reflect the various formation t
ixed halo mass may reflect the various formation times of the halos themselves. In fact, such an idea is supported by the research of Scholz- Díaz et al. (2022) and Oyarzún et al. (2022), who searched for vari- ations in the galaxy properties with stellar mass while controlling for halo mass. In our own results we do find that the Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩ index ratio is generally higher for galaxies that fall above the stel- lar mass–halo mass relation, which indicates a faster accumulation of stellar mass in 
ndicates a faster accumulation of stellar mass in these galaxies. In combination with the shorter gas infall timescales obtained through our semi-analytic spectral fitting approach (see Figure 5), we can naturally speculate that these galaxies reside within dark matter halos that formed systematically earlier than their low stellar mass counterparts. In addition, the spa- tially resolved results shown in Figure 7 provide further evidence for such a scenario: galaxies that have higher stellar-mas
 a scenario: galaxies that have higher stellar-mass to halo- mass ratio formed half of their stellar masses earlier as indicated byt50, but this effect is only prominent in the central region of the galaxies. In the outer parts, there is little evidence that t50corre- lates with either stellar mass or halo mass. As stars in the central regions of these massive galaxies are generally older than those in the outer parts, this result indicates that it is those old stars the ones keeping memory of t
it is those old stars the ones keeping memory of their dark matter halo formation process. The late-formed stars in the outer parts don’t know much about the time the halo formed since the halo formation had almost finished sev- eral Gyrs before their formation. Therefore, the properties of the stars in the outer regions show no correlation with either halo mass or halo formation time. It is worth pointing out that, since both the gas infall and star formation timescales are not linked to the ha
star formation timescales are not linked to the halo formation timescales in a straightforward way, future research that including detailed hydrodynamic simulations is needed to provide more direct physical insights.5 SUMMARY In this work we analyse a sample of massive disk galaxies selected from the SDSS-IV/MaNGA survey to investigate the dependence of the galaxies’ evolution on their stellar and halo masses. We se- lected central galaxies as the most massive members of their group. A sample of
e most massive members of their group. A sample of satellite galaxies with similar stellar masses was also selected for comparison. For each galaxy, we combine the spec- tral data within one effective radius Reto create a high signal-to- noise-ratio spectrum representing its global properties. Data inside the 0.0–0.5 Reand 0.5–1.5 Reregions are also combined to char- acterise the stellar populations in the central and outer regions of the galaxy. We applied a semi-analytic spectral fitting appro
 We applied a semi-analytic spectral fitting approach to the combined data to obtain key physical properties of the galaxies. This approach produces the star-formation and chemical-evolution histories from the galaxies’ data and also determines physical pa- rameters related to gas accretion and outflows, which are key com- ponents of the models. From the best-fit model results, as well as from direct observables such as morphologies, NUV−rcolours, and Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratios, we obtained the follo
, and Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratios, we obtained the following results: •We confirm the canonical ‘down-sizing’ formation scenario in which more massive galaxies tend to accumulate their stellar mass and become chemically enriched earlier than less massive ones. This effect holds even when the mass of the dark matter halo is controlled for. •In addition to the stellar mass, halo mass is also found to have a significant impact on the stellar population properties of the galaxies.

At fixed stellar mass, galaxies in low-mass halos are found to be more metal-enriched and finish star formation earlier than those in more massive halos. •The results based on the semi-analytic fitting process are en- tirely consistent with those based on direct observables such as morphological type, NUV−rcolour, and Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩index ratio of the galaxies. In particular, the star formation timescales indicated by Mgb/ ⟨Fe⟩are in line with the gas infall timescales obtain
⟩are in line with the gas infall timescales obtained through the best-fit chemical evolution models. All these results confirm the correlations with stellar and halo mass described above. •The halo mass of the host group/cluster is found to have lit- tle impact on the evolution of massive satellite galaxies at a given stellar mass. Instead, the evolution of massive satellite galaxies is mainly driven by their stellar masses. •Using spatially resolved data from the inner and outer regions of the 
lved data from the inner and outer regions of the galaxies, we find that only the properties of the central re- gions have a dependence on halo mass. The outer regions of the galaxies seem to know little about the properties of their halos. Based on these results, we discuss the possible physical ori- gins of the dependencies we find. We conclude that at a given stel- lar mass, more massive halos may be more efficient at feeding gas into the central galaxy so that their star formation is long-la
ral galaxy so that their star formation is long-lasting. This gas inflow also dilutes the chemical composition of the ISM in these galaxies, slowing down their chemical enrichment. At a given halo mass, a galaxy with higher stellar mass may live in a halo formed earlier, so that their star formation activity also quenches earlier. These simple physical ideas, backed by more sophisticated hydrodynamic and semi-analytic galaxy evolution models, are able to explain the trends we observe. MNRAS 000,

The main result is a clear dependence of the inner slope of the dark matter density pro- ﬁle,αinρ∝rα, on the ratio between stellar-to-halo mass, M⋆/Mhalo. This relation is inde- pendent of the particular choice of parameters within our st ellar feedback scheme, allowing a prediction for cusp vs core formation.

ith observations of structures on large scal es (e.g. Riesset al. 1998; Komatsu et al. 2011; Hinshaw et al. 20 12; PlanckCollaborationet al. 2013). According to this theory , galax- ies are embedded within dark matter (DM) haloes (White& Rees c/circlecopyrt2010 RAS 2Di Cintioet. al 1978; Blumenthal etal. 1984), whose properties have been ex - tensively studied in the past thanks to numerical N-body sim u- lations (e.g. Springel 2005; Power & Knebe 2006; Macci` o et a l. 2008; Kuhlenet al. 2012).
e 2006; Macci` o et a l. 2008; Kuhlenet al. 2012). Problems at small scales, however , still affectthe ΛCDMmodel, one of whichisthe so-called“cusp-core” problem. A prediction of pure DM collisionless simulations is that dark matter density increases as ρ∝r−1toward the halo center (Navarroet al.1996;Springel et al.2008;Navarroet al.201 0).The existence of such a “cuspy” density proﬁle is in disagreemen t with observations of disc and dwarf galaxies (e.g., Salucci & Bur kert 2000;Simonetal.2005;de
s (e.g., Salucci & Bur kert 2000;Simonetal.2005;de Bloketal.2008;Kuziode Narayet a l. 2008, 2009; Ohetal. 2011), where detailed mass modeling usi ng rotation curves suggests a ﬂatter, or “cored”, DM density pr oﬁle. SimulatedDMhaloesmodeledwithanEinasto(Einasto1965)p ro- ﬁle have a inner slope of −0.7(Graham etal. 2006): this value is closer to what observed in real galaxies (Swaterset al. 2003 ), yet not sufﬁcient tosolve the discrepancy (de Bloketal. 2003).

One possibility, without resorting to more exotic forms of dark matter (e.g. warm dark matter see Avila-Reese etal. 200 1; Bode et al. 2001; Knebe etal. 2002, Macci` o et al. 2012b), is t hat this inconsistency arises from having neglected the effect s of baryons, which are irrelevant on cosmological scales where dark matteranddarkenergydominate, butmaybe dynamically rele vant on small, galactic scales. For example, as gas cools to the ce ntral region of galaxy haloes, it adiabatic
the ce ntral region of galaxy haloes, it adiabatically contracts dark ma tter to the centre (e.g. Blumenthal etal. 1986; Gnedinet al. 2004). Such adiabatic contraction exacerbates the mismatch between th e pro- ﬁles of dark matter haloes and the observed density proﬁles i n- ferred from rotation curves. Further, theoretical models w ith halo contraction are unable to self-consistently reconcile the observed galaxy scaling relations, such as the rotation velocity-lu minosity and size-luminosity r
otation velocity-lu minosity and size-luminosity relations. Un-contracted or expanded haloes are required(Dutton etal. 2007,2011). Two main mechanisms have been shown to cause expan- sion: supernova feedback (Navarroet al. 1996; Mo & Mao 2004; Read& Gilmore 2005; Mashchenko et al. 2006; Pontzen& Governato 2012) and dynamical friction (El-Zante t al. 2001; Tonini et al. 2006; Romano-D´ ıaz etal. 2008; Goerdt et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2011).

They found that theslope αincreases,i.e.theproﬁleﬂattens,withincreasingstella r mass. In this paper we study dark matter density proﬁles in a suite of galaxies drawn from the MUGS (Stinsonetal. 2010) and MaG- ICC projects (Stinsonetal. 2013; Brooket al. 2012).

 Early stellar feedback is included in most of our simulation s. It uses a fraction, ǫesf, of the total luminosity emitted by massive stars. The luminosity of stars is modelled with a simple ﬁt of the mass-luminosity relationship observed in binary systems ( Torres 2010): L L⊙=/braceleftBigg (M/M⊙)4, M < 10M⊙ 100(M/M⊙)2, M > 10M⊙(2) Typically, this model corresponds to the emission of 2×1050erg perM⊙of the entirestellarpopulation over the ∼4.5Myr between a star’s formation and the commencement o

This allows us to make predictions which are independent of the feedback pres crip- tion.

Our study extends the prediction of cores vs cusps to L⋆scales and predicts a turnover in the relation between innerslopeandgalaxymassfor M⋆>108.5M⊙:above thisvalue, the inner slope decreases as α∝ −0.
ove thisvalue, the inner slope decreases as α∝ −0.64log10M⋆/M⊙. Taking a step further, the stellar content of galaxies is the n connected to their observed rotation velocity through the T ully- Fisher (TF) relation. Equation 4 of Duttonet al.

The major difference between αmeasured at 0.01< r/Rvir<0.02and the other radial ranges is that the inn

A steeper slope is expected because 0.01< r/R vir<0.02is further from thegalaxycentrethantheothertwomeasurements. However, none of the measured αvalues fall below the NFW expectation as Vrot approaches 250 kms−1.

The inner proﬁle slope depe nds solelyonthemassofstarsformedperhalomassandisindepen dent of the particular choice of feedback parameters within our b last- wave and early stellar feedback scheme. Similar to previous work, the expansion of the dark matter proﬁle results from superno va- driven outﬂows that cause ﬂuctuations in the global potenti al and shift the centre of the gas mass away from the centre of the dar k matter mass. Atvaluesof M⋆/Mhalo<∼0.01perc
e dar k matter mass. Atvaluesof M⋆/Mhalo<∼0.01percent,theenergyfromstel- lar feedback is not sufﬁcient to modify the DM distribution, and these galaxies retain a cuspy proﬁle. At higher ratios of ste llar- to-halo mass, feedback drives the expansion of the DM haloes , resulting in cored proﬁles. The shallowest proﬁles form in g alax- ies with M⋆/Mhalo∼0.5per cent. According to the abun- dance matching relation (Moster etal. 2013), these galaxie s have Mhalo≈1010.8M⊙andM⋆≈108.5M⊙. In higher mass 
 have Mhalo≈1010.8M⊙andM⋆≈108.5M⊙. In higher mass haloes, the deepening of the potential due to stars that form in the ce ntral regions suppresses supernova-driven outﬂows and thus lowe rs ex- pansion, leavingcuspier proﬁles. The abundance matching peak of star formation efﬁciency, M⋆/Mhalo= 3.8per cent, occurs at Mhalo= 1011.76M⊙, which is close tothe lowest current estimate of the Milky Waymass. Our model predicts that such a halo will be uncontracted and have an NFW-like inner slope of α=−1.2
tracted and have an NFW-like inner slope of α=−1.20when the slope is measured between∼2and∼4kpc. We combine our parameterization of αas a function of M⋆/Mhalowith the empirical abundance matching relation to as- sign a median relationship between αandM⋆. The inner slope of the dark matter density proﬁle increases with stellar mas s to a maximum (most cored proﬁle) at M⋆≈108.5M⊙, before decreasing toward cuspier proﬁles at higher stellar masses .

Be- lowM⋆≈108.5M⊙the DM inner slope increases with stellar mass asα∝0.34log10M⋆/M⊙, similar to the relation found in Governato etal. (2012). For M⋆>108.5M⊙, dark matter haloes become cuspier, with α∝ −0.64log10M⋆/M⊙.The Tully-Fisher relation allows us to predict the dependen ce oftheDMinnerslopeontheobservedrotationvelocityofgal axies.

disc galaxies, being baryon dominated, suf- fer from larger uncertainties in the disc-halo decompositi on of their rotation curves, making it difﬁcult to distinguish if their dark matter proﬁle is cuspy or cored. Some studies conclude t hat such galaxies, those with Vrot>150kms−1, can be described with cored proﬁles (Borriello&Salucci 2001; Donatoet al. 2 004; McGaugh et al. 2007), while others ﬁnd that NFW model provide equally good ﬁts for these high luminosity galaxies (de Blok et al. 2008; K
e high luminosity galaxies (de Blok et al. 2008; Kuziode Narayet al.2008). More recently, Martinsson et al. (2013) presented rotation - curve mass decompositions of several massive spiral galaxi es, and found no signiﬁcant difference between the quality of a pseu do- isothermalsphereoraNFWmodelinﬁttingtheDMrotationcur ves of individual galaxies, given the uncertainties in the cont ribution of baryons. If high surface brightness discs are sub-maxima l (e.g. Courteau& Rix 1999) their haloes are al

An aspect not taken into account in our simulations of galaxy formation is the inﬂuence of AGN feedback on the density proﬁ le of dark matter haloes. We acknowledge that this form of feedb ack starts to be relevant at the high halo mass end, where we obser ve increasingly cuspy galaxies: the study of the core/cusp pro blem would thus beneﬁt from a future implementation of this type o f feedback. Our novel predict

Our novel prediction for cusp vs core formation can be tested and,atleastatthelowhalomassend,wellconstrainedusing obser- vationaldatasets.Thisstudycanbeappliedtotheoretical modeling of galaxy mass proﬁles, as well as to modeling of populations of disc galaxies within cold dark matter haloes. We ﬁnd this enc our- aging, and hope that our study motivates more systematic ana lysis of the dependance of αongalaxy mass inrealdisc galaxies. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors

mine the relationship b etween the stellar masses of galaxies and the masses of their host dark matter haloes over the en- tire cosmic history from z∼4 to the present. This multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model self-consistently takes into account that satellite g alaxies ﬁrst become satellites at times earlier than they are observed. We employ a redsh ift-dependent pa- rameterization of the stellar-to-halo mass relation to populate halo es and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with 
 and subhaloes in the Millennium simulations with galaxies, requiring that the observed s tellar mass functions at several redshifts be reproduced simultaneously. We show that physically meaningful growth of massive galaxies is consistent with these data only if obser- vational mass errors are taken into account. Using merger trees extracted from the dark matter simulations in combination with MEAM, we predict the aver ageassembly histories of galaxies, separating into star formation within the 
laxies, separating into star formation within the galax ies (in-situ) and accretion of stars (ex-situ). Our main results are: The peak star formation eﬃciency decreases with redshift from 23 per cent at z= 0 to 9 per cent at z= 4 while the corresponding halo mass increases from 1011.8M⊙to 1012.5M⊙. The star formation rate of central galaxies peaks at a redshift which depends on halo m ass; for massive haloes this peak is at early cosmic times while for low-mass galaxies the p eak has not been re
le for low-mass galaxies the p eak has not been reached yet. In haloes similar to that of the Milky-Way abou t half of the central stellar mass is assembled after z= 0.7. In low-mass haloes, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies , while in massive haloes more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex-situ w ith signiﬁcant accretion of satellites at z <2.

In this framework, galaxy formation is driven by the growth of the underlying large-scale structur e and the formation of dark matter haloes: galaxies form by the cooling and condensation of gas at the centres of the ⋆moster@mpa-garching.mpg.depotential wells of 
the ⋆moster@mpa-garching.mpg.depotential wells of such dark matter haloes (White & Rees 1978; Fall & Efstathiou 1980). This results in a tight correlation between the physical properties of galaxies, s uch as their stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR), and the mass of the haloes by which they are hosted. Galaxy formation studies have adopted several ap- proaches to link galaxy properties to those of the dark matter haloes. The most direct is to model the phys- ical mechanisms that drive th
s to model the phys- ical mechanisms that drive the formation of galaxies from ﬁrst principles. Here, an N-body treatment of the dark matter evolution is combined with a treatment of the baryonic component based either on a hydro- dynamical (Katz et al. 1996; Springel & Hernquist 2003; 2B. P. Moster et al. Kereˇ s et al. 2005; Crain et al. 2009; Schaye et al. 2010; Oppenheimer et al. 2010) or on a semi-analytic method (Kauﬀmann et al. 1999; Springel et al. 2001; Hatton et al. 2003; Springel et a
gel et al. 2001; Hatton et al. 2003; Springel et al. 2005; Kang et al. 2005; Croton et al. 2006; Bower et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2011). Despite substan- tial progress, simpliﬁed and uncertain recipes must still b e employed to model the formation of stars and black holes and the associated feedback processes, and the detailed properties and evolution of observed galaxy populations ar e still only partially reproduced. An alternative approach to link galaxies to haloes has emerged with the accumula
k galaxies to haloes has emerged with the accumulation of data from large galaxy surveys (Cole et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2003; Drory et al. 2005; Fontana et al. 2006; Panter et al. 2007; P´ erez-Gonz´ alez et al. 2008; Li & White 2009; Santini et al. 2012). Instead of attempting to model the baryonic physics that drive galaxy formation, dark matter haloes are popu- lated with galaxies usingasimple empirical method with ad- justable parameters. In the popular halo occupation distri - bution (HOD) 
the popular halo occupation distri - bution (HOD) formalism, the distribution of galaxies (hav- ing certain intrinsic properties such as luminosity, color , or type) within main haloes of a given mass is constrained using galaxy abundance and clustering statistics (e.g. Peacock & Smith 2000; White 2001; Berlind & Weinberg 2002; Zehavi et al. 2004; Tinker et al. 2005; Brown et al. 2008; Zehavi et al. 2011; Wake et al. 2011; Leauthaud et al. 2012). A variant of the classical HOD approach is the co
 A variant of the classical HOD approach is the con- ditional luminosity function (CLF) formalism (Yang et al. 2003; van den Bosch et al. 2003; Yang et al. 2011). Since reliable galaxy clustering measurements are unavailable a t high redshift, the HOD and CLF approaches have typically been used at low redshift. In order to circumvent this problem, galaxies can be linked to the underlying substructure directly by assum- ing a monotonic relation between stellar mass and halo mass, and matching the
tween stellar mass and halo mass, and matching the cumulative abundance of galax- ies to those of haloes and subhaloes (Vale & Ostriker 2004; Conroy et al. 2006; Shankar et al. 2006; Vale & Ostriker 2006; Moster et al. 2010; Guo et al. 2010; Behroozi et al. 2010). The only observational input to this ‘abundance matching’ method is thus the observed stellar mass func- tion (SMF) or luminosity function. This approach then pre- dicts clustering statistics remarkably well. In this frame - work, the 
istics remarkably well. In this frame - work, the stellar-to-halo-mass (SHM) relation can be ob- tained in two ways: The ﬁrst (e.g. Conroy et al. 2006) is to create a mock galaxy catalogue from the observed SMF for the simulated volume, to order both galaxies and haloes by mass, and then to match them one by one. A ﬁttingfunction can then be used to get the SHM relation. The second way (e.g. Moster et al. 2010) is ﬁrst to assume a functional form for the SHM relation, and then to populate the ha
 for the SHM relation, and then to populate the haloes with galaxies and compute the model SMF. The parameters of the SHM function are then adjusted so that the observed SMF is reproduced. The latter approach has the advantage that scatter in stellar mass at a given halo mass can easily be added. The underlying assumptions in this model are that satellite galaxies are living in subhaloes and were central galaxies before their own haloes were accreted and became subhaloes. The properties of the g
eted and became subhaloes. The properties of the galaxy population today are thusa consequenceof the formation of central galaxies i n main haloes at diﬀerent redshifts and the subsequent accre-tion and evolution of satellites. Since the subhalo is aﬀect ed much more by tidal stripping than the galaxy at its centre, thestellar massofsatellites ismorecloselyrelatedtosub halo mass at the time of accretion rather than to current sub- halo mass. Most abundance matching studies simply assign the infa
 abundance matching studies simply assign the infall mass to subhaloes. As pointed out by Yang et al. (2011), this is equivalent to assuming that the SHM relation does not evolve with redshift, i.e. that the relation betwee n the stellar mass of central galaxies and their halo mass to- day is the same as the relation between the stellar mass of satellite galaxies and their halo mass at the time of accre- tion. However, applying the technique at diﬀerent redshift s results in an evolving SHM rela
iﬀerent redshift s results in an evolving SHM relation (e.g. Conroy et al. 2006; Moster et al. 2010). This indicates that the classical abun- dance matching approach is not self-consistent. This problem can be solved if we assign the stellar mass of the satellites depending on the infall mass of their sub- haloandthe infall redshift. The stellar mass of the central galaxies still depends on the main halo mass at the redshift of observation in the same way. This is equivalent to as- suming that t
 same way. This is equivalent to as- suming that the stellar mass of a satellite does not change, once it has entered the main halo. In order to implement this scheme, we ﬁrst use the classical abundance matching approach to see how the parameters of the SHM relation depend on redshift and ﬁnd a redshift-dependent parame- terization of the SHM relation m∗(Mh,z). We then employ this parameterization to put a galaxy at the centre of every halo and subhalo in the simulation at all redshifts between
subhalo in the simulation at all redshifts between z= 0 and z= 4, adjusting the parameters of the relation to reproduce simultaneously all the observed SMFs in this redshift range. In this way we use a self-consistent relatio n between stellar mass, halo mass and redshift for both cen- trals and satellites. Statistical models, such as the abundance matching ap- proach, are typically employed to derive constraints on the relation between galaxy properties and halo mass at a given epoch. With the 
operties and halo mass at a given epoch. With the advent of wide high-redshift surveys, it has become possible to use this connection, together with in- formation on the evolution of dark matter haloes, to study the evolution of galaxy properties throughout their histor y (e.g. White et al. 2007; Conroy et al. 2007). In particular, Conroy & Wechsler (2009) show how this method can be extended to put constraints on the SFR of galaxies. For this they use an analytic prescription for galaxy and hal
ey use an analytic prescription for galaxy and halo abun- dances and the evolution of haloes, focusing on z∼<1. We follow asimilar approach, butuse N-bodysimulations toget halo abundances and assembly histories. Then we identify the progenitors of a given halo at an earlier epoch and derive the amount of stellar mass that has been accreted onto the central galaxy and the total stellar mass by which it grew. Finally, employing a recipe to account for stellar mass loss , we compute the stellar mas
for stellar mass loss , we compute the stellar mass that has been formed through star formation and convert this into a SFR. We are thus able to derive the star formation history (SFH) of the galaxy at the centre of the halo. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we de- scribe the N-body simulations including the halo ﬁnding algorithm and the treatment of ‘orphan’ galaxies. We also summarize the observational SMFs that have been used. In Section 3 we describe the details of the model
 In Section 3 we describe the details of the model that matches galaxies to haloes. In Section 4 we use this relation and the halo accretion histories to derive SFR histories as a functi on Galactic star formation and accretion histories 3 of halo mass and we show that our model can reproduce the observedevolution of the cosmic SFRdensityandof the spe- ciﬁc SFRs of galaxies. We discuss some of the implications of our model in Section 5 and summarize in Section 6. Throughout this paper, we assume
ize in Section 6. Throughout this paper, we assume a ‘WMAP7’ ΛCDM cosmology with (Ω m,ΩΛ,Ωb,h,n,σ 8) = (0.272,0.728,0.046,0.704,0.967,0.810). We employ a Chabrier (2003) initial mass function (IMF) and we con- vert all stellar masses to this IMF. All virial masses are computed with respect to 200 times the critical density. In order to simplify the notation, we will use the capital Mto denote dark matter halo masses and the lower case mto denote galaxy stellar masses. 2 SIMULATIONS AND OBSERVATI
galaxy stellar masses. 2 SIMULATIONS AND OBSERVATIONS In this paper we aim to link observable properties of galax- ies to the underlying dark matter distribution using a sta- tistical sample of both galaxies and dark matter haloes. The properties of the halo population originate from two N-body simulations: the Millennium Simulation (MS Springel et al. 2005) for massive haloes and the Millennium-II Simulation (MS-II Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2009) for lower mass haloes. For the galaxy population at 
r lower mass haloes. For the galaxy population at low redshift we use the precise stellar mass functions of Li & White (2009) based on the spectroscopic data set of the Sloan Digital Sky Sur- vey (SDSS York et al. 2000). At high redshift we use two sets of observed SMFs: for massive galaxies we use the SMFs by P´ erez-Gonz´ alez et al. (2008, PG08) taken from a wide survey, and for low-mass galaxies we use the SMFs by Santini et al. (2012, S12) taken from a deep survey. 2.1 Numerical Simulations
aken from a deep survey. 2.1 Numerical Simulations Both Millennium simulations adopt the concordance ΛCDM cosmology with parameters chosen to agree with the ﬁrst- yearWilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) data (Spergel et al. 2003). As these parameters are not consisten t with the latest WMAP data analysis, we use the scaling recipe by Angulo & White (2010) to convert the properties of the simulations to represent the growth of structure in aWMAP7 cosmology. Speciﬁcally, we chose Ω m= 0.27

Both simulations were carried out in a periodic box ad- vancing 21603dark matter particles from redshift z∼127 to 0. The side length of the box is 761 Mpc for the MS, and 152 Mpc for the MS-II. The corresponding particle masses are 1.58×109M⊙and 1.27×107M⊙, respectively. The large volume ofthe MSenables ustosample reliably eventhe cen- tral galaxies of rar

Dark matter haloes are identiﬁed at each output using a friends-of-friends (FoF) halo ﬁnder that links together p ar- ticles with separation less than 0.2 of the mean interpartic le distance. Substructures inside the FoF groups are then iden - tiﬁed using subfind (Springel et al. 2001). The most mas- sive self-bound subgroup is deﬁned as the ‘
t mas- sive self-bound subgroup is deﬁned as the ‘main halo’, and all other subgroups within the FoF groups are referred to as ‘subhaloes’. The virial radius and mass of the main haloesare determined with a spherical overdensity criterion: the density inside a sphere centered on the most bound particle is required tobe equal to 200 times thecritical value. Merge r trees were then built to link each subhalo found at a given snapshot (includingthe main haloes) toauniquedescendant in the following 
main haloes) toauniquedescendant in the following snapshot. With these merger trees we can track the evolution of each halo throughout the simulation. In this work, we assume that both main haloes and subhaloes host galaxies at their centres. We will refer to th e galaxy at the center of a distinct halo as a ‘central galaxy’, and the galaxies within subhaloes as ‘satellites’. There is thus one central galaxy within each FoF group but there may be any number of sattelites (including zero). Ab ini
 any number of sattelites (including zero). Ab initio models of galaxy formation predict that the stellar mass of a galaxy is tightly correlated with the depth of the potentia l well of the halo in which it formed. For central galaxies, the relevant mass is the virial mass of the main halo at the time of observation, but for satellites the situation is more complex: Subhaloes lose mass while orbiting in a larger system as their outer regions are tidally stripped. Stars ar e centrallyconcentrated
tidally stripped. Stars ar e centrallyconcentratedandmoretightlyboundthanthedark matter, however, so the stellar mass of a satellite galaxy changes only slightly after it enters a larger halo. Therefo re the subhalo mass at the time of observation is not a good tracer for the stellar mass of asatellite. A better tracer is the subhalo mass at the time that it was accreted by the main halo, whichtypicallycorrespondstothemaximummassover its history. Duetotheﬁnitemassresolution ofthesimulations, sub
 Duetotheﬁnitemassresolution ofthesimulations, sub- haloes can no longer be identiﬁed once their mass has been tidally stripped below the resolution limit. Since mass los s can be substantial this is important even for fairly massive subhaloes.Aspecial treatmentoftheseso-called ‘orphans ’ is necessary. Wedeterminetheorbital parameters thelast tim e a subhalo is identiﬁed in the simulation and use them in the dynamical friction formula of Binney & Tremaine (1987): tdf=αdfVvirr2 sat GMsatlnΛ, (1)

Fol- lowing De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) we set αdf= 2.34, which was also found to be appropriate in the N-body studies by Boylan-Kolchin et al. (2008). We retain the disrupted sub- halo for the purposes of abundance matching until a ti

At low redshift ( z= 0.1), the SDSS galaxy catalogues allow a determination of the local SMF down to a stellar mass of 107M⊙. Above about 10
MF down to a stellar mass of 107M⊙. Above about 108M⊙it is ro- bust against incompleteness. The large volume of the sam- ple leads to very low uncertainties due to cosmic variance (Trenti & Stiavelli 2008; Moster et al. 2011). We employ the recent measurements by Li & White 4B. P. Moster et al. (2009), based on a complete and uniform sample from the SDSS/DR7 (Abazajian et al. 2009), and we use the conver- sion to stellar mass based on the SDSS r-band model lumi- nosities, as derived by Guo et al
band model lumi- nosities, as derived by Guo et al. (2010). This SMF ranges from stellar masses of 108.3M⊙to 1011.7M⊙. In order to ex- tend the SMF to even lower stellar masses, we include the measurements by Baldry et al. (2008) between 107.4M⊙and 108.3M⊙. As we aim at constraining the stellar mass content of haloes back to z= 4 we require high-quality observed SMFs at high redshift. In general wide high-redshift surveys cap - ture many massive galaxies but are not deep enough to con- strain th
galaxies but are not deep enough to con- strain the low-mass tail of the SMF. Conversely, deep sur- veys cover too small volumes to constrain the massive tail. In practice obtaining a SMF that is equally well constrained for massive and low-mass galaxies is diﬃcult, as this would involve a survey that is both wide (capturing many mas- sive galaxies) and deep (detecting even galaxies of very low mass). We use the mass functions of the wide survey of P´ erez-Gonz´ alez et al. (2008) to constrain t
of P´ erez-Gonz´ alez et al. (2008) to constrain the massive end . These SMFs have been derived in 12 redshift bins from a sample of galaxies at 0 < z <4 selected in three diﬀer- ent ﬁelds at 3 .6−4.5µmwith the Infrared Array Cam- era (Fazio et al. 2004) on board the Spitzer Space Tele- scope (Werner et al. 2004).

For the low-mass end we use SMFs in 6 redshift bins by Santini et al. (2012), which have been obtained from Early Release Science observations taken in the Y,J, andH-bands with the near-IR Wide Field Camera 3 on board HST (Windhorst et al. 2011), and from deep K- band images taken with the near-IR VLT image

The galaxy catalogue has been se- lected in the K-band, covers an area of 33 arcmin2, and is complete to a typical magnitude of K= 25.5. This very deep, albeit narrow, survey is able to resolve galaxies of lo w mass up to z= 4.5, and allows us to study the evolution of low-mass galaxies in detail. For all SMFs we have con- verted the stellar masses to agree with a Chabrier IMF. An overviewofthe19SMFsusedinthiswo

For this we ﬁrst need to specify the SHM ra- tio. A direct comparison of the halo mass function and the stellar mass function shows that the baryons are converted into stars with very diﬀerent eﬃciencies in haloes of diﬀer- ent mass. Star fo

Star formation is most eﬃcient in systems like the Milky Way with Mvir∼1012M⊙, and is substantially less eﬃcient in much more massive or much less massive haloes. We adopt the parameterization of the SHM ratio ofFigure 1.

The halo mass where the SHM ratio is maximal is related to the characteristic massM1by Mmax=M1/parenleftbiggβ γ/parenrightbigg1/(β+γ) . (3) This SHM ratio can then be used to compute the aver- age stellar mass in a dark matter halo. However, we expect that two haloes of the same mass Mmay harbor galaxies with diﬀ
oes of the same mass Mmay harbor galaxies with diﬀerent stellar masses, since they can have diﬀerent halo concentrations, spin parameters, and merger historie s. Therefore we assume an intrinsic scatter around this aver- age relation when assigning the stellar mass to an individua l galaxy: we draw a stellar mass mfrom a lognormal distri- bution with a mean value given by equation (2) and with a scatter of σm(logm) = 0.15.

For M1andNwe assume a second order polynomial in zand forβandγa power law in z. 3.1 The evolution of the stellar-to-halo mass relation As a ﬁrst step, we investigate how the parameters of the SHM relation evolve with redshift. For this we assume that at a given redshift the relation betw
 assume that at a given redshift the relation between the stellar mass of a satellite galaxy and the maximum mass of its dark mat- ter halo over its history is the same as the SHM relation of central galaxies. This assumption is only an approximation as the stellar mass of satellites is related to the halo mass at infall and the SHM relation is expected to have changed since this epoch. However, at any redshift the number of subhaloes of a given mass is lower than the number of main haloes of th
mass is lower than the number of main haloes of the same mass, so the approximation is not greatly in error. With this approach we are able study how the pa- rameters of the SHM relation depend on redshift, and which functional form may be appropriate. In order to constrain the parameters at a given red- shift (where an observed SMF is available), we populate the haloes in the simulation with galaxies using the SHM rela- tion to derive their stellar masses. Once the simulation box is ﬁlled with 
lar masses. Once the simulation box is ﬁlled with galaxies, it is straightforward to compute the model SMF. We then assign a likelihood to this model SMFby relating it to the observed SMF at this redshift: L= exp/parenleftbig −χ2 r/parenrightbig χ2 r=1 NΦNΦ/summationdisplay i=1/parenleftbigglogΦmod(mi)−logΦobs(mi) σobs(mi)/parenrightbigg2 .(4) Employing a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we sample the probability distribution for the parameters andextract thebest-ﬁtvaluesand their1 σerror

The transition mass M1increases with increasing red- shift and reaches a maximum around z∼2, after which it stays constant or even slightly decreases again. This means that atz= 0 the conversion of baryons into stars has been mosteﬃcient inhaloes withavirial mass oflog( Mvir/M⊙)∼ 11.7, while at higher redshift the conversion was most e
while at higher redshift the conversion was most eﬃ- cient in more massive haloes with log( Mvir/M⊙)∼12.3. The normalization N, i.e. the SHM ratio at the most eﬃ- cient halo mass, decreases with increasing redshift, reach es a minimum around z∼2 and then increases again. We note that this does not imply that individual galaxies lose mass as halo mass generally increases for an individual system. 6B. P. Moster et al. Figure 3.

The arrow shows the evolutio n of a system with Mvir(z= 0) = 1014M⊙fromz= 1 to 0, indicating that if observational mass errors are not accounted for, mas sive systems lose signiﬁcantly more stellar mass than expected f rom stellar evol
more stellar mass than expected f rom stellar evolution models. The low-mass slope βis only constrained by the S12 SMFs. This is a consequence of the properties of the surveys from whichtheSMFs areobtained: ThesurveyinPG08does not provide strong constraints on the low-mass slope of the SMFs and consequently on β. The survey used in S12, on the other hand, is able to detect low-mass galaxies. From these constraints, we see that βis decreasing with redshift, which means that the slope of the SHM r

These constraints indicate that γis also decreasing with redshift, i.e. the slope of the SHM relation becomes steeper with in- creasing redshift. 3.2 The multi-epoch abundance matching model As we now have a ﬁrst idea how the SHM parameters should evolve with redshift, we can construct a self-consistent model. As the next s
n construct a self-consistent model. As the next step in this multi-epoch abundance matching (MEAM) model, we determine a convenient red- shift parameterization of the SHM parameters. For the char- acteristic mass M1andthenormalization N, we useasecond order polynomial in z, while for the slopes βandγwe use a power law: logM1(z) =M10+M11z+M12z2, (5) N(z) =N10+N11z+N12z2, (6) β(z) =β10(z+1)β11, (7) γ(z) =γ10(z+1)γ11. (8) The stellar mass of a central galaxy is then given asa function of the viria
ral galaxy is then given asa function of the virial mass of its dark matter halo Mvir and redshift z. For satellite galaxies, the stellar mass is now determined by employing the SHM relation at the time at which it still was a central galaxy, i.e. at the redshift of in fall zinf. We then assume that the stellar mass of a satellite does not change after its subhalo entered the main halo, i.e. we neglect stellar stripping and star formation in the satellite. We thus get a redshift-dependent SHM re
satellite. We thus get a redshift-dependent SHM relation m(M,z) that depends on the virial mass of the main halo and redshift at the current epoch for central galaxies and on the infall mass of the subhalo and infall redshift for satell ite galaxies. The stellar mass of a galaxy at redshift zis then given by m=/braceleftBigg m(Mvir,z) for host haloes m(Minf,zinf) for subhaloes .(9) In this way we can derive the stellar mass of any galaxy just by employing the redshift-dependent SHM relation for

To this end we employ the simulation at all redshifts where an observed SMF is available and pop- ulate all main haloes and subhaloes in the simulation with galaxies using the redshift-dependent SHM relation to de- rive their stellar masses. We then compute the Nzmodel SMFs for each redshift and assign a likelihood to the model by relating them to the correspo

We show the results in Figure 2 for the simultaneous ﬁt to all SMFs (black line and shaded area). Fo

The SHM relation for a set of redshifts between z= 0 andz= 4 is plotted in Figure 3. At a ﬁxed halo mass at the high-mass end (log( Mvir/M⊙)∼>13.0), the stellar mass in- creases with with increasing redshift. At intermediate hal o masses (log( Mvir/M⊙)∼12.0) the stellar mass decreases with increasing redshift, 
 stellar mass decreases with increasing redshift, reaches a minimum at z∼2 and then increases again (reﬂecting the evolution of the normal - izationN). The fact that at a given halo mass the mass of thecentral galaxyis lower atpresentthanatanearlier epoc h does not necessarily imply that individual galaxies lose ma ss during their evolution, as haloes also become more massive over time. At a ﬁxed halo mass of log( Mvir/M⊙) = 12.0 the model stellar mass is log( m∗/M⊙) = 10.5 atz= 4 and only log(m
r mass is log( m∗/M⊙) = 10.5 atz= 4 and only log(m∗/M⊙) = 10.2 atz= 2. However, a typical halo with log(Mvir/M⊙) = 12.0 atz= 4 will increase its virial mass up to log( Mvir/M⊙) = 12.7 atz= 2, for which the model stellar mass is log( m∗/M⊙) = 11.0, so that the stellar mass of the central galaxy does not decrease, but increase.

The solid line corresponds to the multi-epoch abundance ma tching model. The shaded area indicates the 1 σconﬁdence levels. For all four parameters we assume a linear dependence on the expansion factora= (1 +z)−1. However, we encounter a se
sion factora= (1 +z)−1. However, we encounter a severe problem for massive galaxies at low redshift: the growth of halo mass cannot compensate for the decreasing stellar mass. A typical mas- sive halo of log( Mvir/M⊙) = 14.0 atz= 0 has grown from az= 1 halo with a virial mass of log( Mvir/M⊙) = 13.6. The model stellar mass for the central galaxy of this sys- tem atz= 1 is log( m∗/M⊙) = 11.4, while at z= 0 it is only log( m∗/M⊙) = 11.3. This would imply that massive systems lose stellar mass at l
 imply that massive systems lose stellar mass at low redshift and is unphysical, as stellar mass loss rates from supernovae are much lower than accretion rates onto the central galaxy. This indicate s that an important eﬀect has been neglected in our model and that the eﬀects of this missing ingredient are most se- vere at the massive end. In the following section we show that neglecting errors in the observed stellar mass impacts the results for massive galaxies strongly and that taking th is i
 massive galaxies strongly and that taking th is into account results in a model where galaxies do not lose stellar mass during their evolution.3.3 Introducing observational mass errors in the model Estimating stellar masses for an observed sample of galaxie s involves obtaining the luminosities of the galaxies and the n converting these to stellar masses through a stellar popu- lation synthesis model and dust corrections. The errors in- troduced in all these steps are typically of the order of 
 in all these steps are typically of the order of the uncertainties in the stellar populations synthesis analys is. Assuming that these errors are Gaussian, the shape of the SMF implies that at a given observed mass there are more galaxies with a lower true mass than galaxies with a higher true mass, i.e. more galaxies are scattered in than scattere d out. As a result the observed SMF is shallower than the true SMF, particularly at the massive end. It is important to include this eﬀect in our mo
d. It is important to include this eﬀect in our model. We do this by adding a Gaussian scatter to the stellar mass of each model galaxy. An ‘observed’ stellar mass in our model is thus obtained in three steps: We ﬁrst compute the average mass for a given halo mass and redshift (or infall halo mass and infall redshift for subhaloes), then we add a ﬁxedintrinsic scatter of σm(logm) = 0.15 dex to account for diﬀerent halo parameters and histories, and ﬁnally we add an observational scatter to accou

The results are plotted in Figure 4 
o be adopted. The results are plotted in Figure 4 (sym- bols with errorbars). As for the ﬁt without observational mass errors, the transition mass M1increases with increas- ing redshift. This increase is strong at low redshift, while at high redshift M1increases only slightly. Unlike before we do not ﬁnd that M1has a maximum beyond which it decreases again. This result implies that at high redshift, massive haloes with log( Mvir/M⊙)∼12.5 are most eﬃcient in converting baryons into stars, while a
 eﬃcient in converting baryons into stars, while at lower redshift th e halo mass for which the baryon conversion eﬃciency is max- imal, decreases towards log( Mvir/M⊙)∼11.6. The normalization N(the conversion eﬃciency at the peak) is now found to decrease monotonically with redshift. The reason why the normalization does not change much at low redshift with respect to the model without observa- tional scatter, but is very diﬀerent at high redshift, is the evolution of the low-mass slope αof the
ft, is the evolution of the low-mass slope αof the SMF. At low red- shift this slope is very shallow, so relatively few galaxies are scattered from lower masses towards the characteristic mas s of the SMF (which corresponds to the peak eﬃciency). At high redshift, the low-mass slope is much steeper, so that more galaxies are scattered towards (and beyond) the mass of the peak eﬃciency. As a result, the observed SMFs at low redshift are very similar to the true SMFs, while at high red- shift the 
ar to the true SMFs, while at high red- shift the observed SMFs are shifted towards higher masses. Therefore it appears as if the normalization is increasing at high redshift, if the observational mass error is not take n intoaccount. Whenwe accountfor this,we ﬁndthatthetrue SMFs are shifted to lower masses and the normalization of the SHM ratio Nno longer increases at high redshift. The results for the low-mass slope βare very similar to what we found before. This is a consequence of the shal- 
 found before. This is a consequence of the shal- low low-mass slope of the SMFs, so that the observational mass error does not change the SMFs much. As before, βis decreasing with increasing redshift, so that the slope of th e SHM relation becomes shallower with increasing redshift. Again,βis only constrained by the S12 SMFs. The high-mass slope γis very diﬀerent to what was found without observational mass errors. Where before γwas decreasing with increasing redshift, we now ﬁnd that γ is incr
ith increasing redshift, we now ﬁnd that γ is increasing. The reason for this is the steep slope of the SMFs at the massive end, which means that the true SMFs areevensteeperthantheobservedSMFs. Therefore thehigh mass slope of the SHM relation has to become shallower which yields a larger γ. Here, the constraints are provided only by the PG08 SMFs, as only this survey is wide enough to detect very massive galaxies. 3.3.2 The multi-epoch abundance matching model including observational mass error
 matching model including observational mass errors Now that we have checked how the SHM parameters evolve withredshift, we canagain employour self-consistent mode l. As this evolution is found to be diﬀerent with respect to the model without observational mass errors, we ﬁrst need to determine the new redshift parameterization of the SHM parameters. As all parameters evolve considerably at low redshift, butevolve only slightly at high redshift, we foun d it more convenienttousealinear dependenc

Again we employ the simulation at those redshifts where an observed SMF is available and populate all main haloes and subhaloes in the simulation with galaxies using the redshift-dependent SHM relation to derive their stellar masses. We then compute the 19 model SMFs and employ an MCMC method to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt values and their 1 
MCMC method to ﬁnd the best-ﬁt values and their 1 σerrors. The results are summarized in Table 1. We show the results in Figure 4 for the simultaneous ﬁt to all SMFs (black line and shaded area). The redshift evolution of all four SHM parameters in the simultaneous ﬁt follow the trends that have been seen for the ﬁts at indi- vidual redshifts. We plot the SHM relation and the baryon conversion eﬃciency for a set of redshifts between z= 0 and z= 4 in Figure 5. At a ﬁxed halo mass, the stellar mas

As a consequence, all central galaxie s grow with time. Moreover, independentofhalo mass, we

Finally we compare our model SMFs to the observed ones in Figure 6. The model SMFs have been computed using the result of the simultaneous ﬁt to all SMFs, i.e. the parameters given in Table 1. The dashed lines show the ‘true’ SMFs, that have been computed after intrinsic scatte r has been added to the galaxy catalogue, b
scatte r has been added to the galaxy catalogue, but before obser- vational mass error. The solid lines show the model SMFs, after mass errors have been included. At low redshift and at low stellar masses, the observational mass errors do not im- pact the shape of the SMFs signiﬁcantly, as the slope of the SMF is shallower than at higher redshift and at the massive end. Beyond the characteristic stellar mass, the ‘true’ SMF s are much steeper than the observed ones, so that there are substantial
n the observed ones, so that there are substantially fewer very massive galaxies at high redshift than the observational SMFs appear to indicate. The model SMFs includingobservational mass error are in very good agreement with the observed SMFs. This in- dicates, that our parameterization of the redshift evoluti on of the SHM relation is compatible with observational con- straints. However, there are a number of discrepancies, tha t stem mainly from the fact that the observed SMFs of dif- ferent
rom the fact that the observed SMFs of dif- ferent authors are not in agreement. The SMF of PG08 at low redshift ( z= 0.1) is higher than our model, while the SDSS SMF is ﬁt very well. The reason for this is that the SDSS has much smaller errors than the PG08 SMF, so that during the ﬁt a much higher likelihood is given to the model that agrees with the SDSS. At higher redshift there are dis- crepancies between the model and the observed SMFs at the low-mass end. While the model overpredicts the 
he low-mass end. While the model overpredicts the abundance of low-mass galaxies with respect to the PG08 SMFs, it un- derpredicts the abundance with respect to the S12 SMFs. This is due to the PG08 SMFs having a much shallowerslope than the S12 SMFs. As the errors on both sets of ob- servations are of the same order, a model is favored that yields average abundances. 4 THE EVOLUTION OF THE STELLAR CONTENT Having constrained the evolution of the SHM relation for centralgalaxies, wecannowuseourmo
SHM relation for centralgalaxies, wecannowuseourmodeltoinfertheevolu- tion of the stellar content of galaxies. To this end we employ the dark matter halo merger trees that have been extracted from the MSandMS-II. These merger trees connect haloes at any given epoch to their descendants at later epochs or to their progenitors at earlier epochs. As our redshift- dependentSHM relation determines the connection between galaxies and haloes at any epoch, we can use the connection between haloes across
h, we can use the connection between haloes across time to infer the connection between galaxies across time. By averaging over a sample of haloes with the same mass at z= 0, our model yields the average stellar mass growth of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. We apply this method for sets of halo masses between 1011M⊙and 1014M⊙. This analysis is related to previous studies that employed semi-analytic models (De Lucia et al. 2006; De Lucia & Blaizot 2007; Guo & White 2008). For a comp
ucia & Blaizot 2007; Guo & White 2008). For a comparison and discussion we refer to Section 5. As a ﬁrst step, we select a sample of merger trees by ﬁxing the virial mass of the main halo at z= 0. In the next step, we populate the haloes in these merger trees using our redshift-dependent SHM relation to compute the stellar masses of their central galaxies. At every epoch, i.e. simu- lation snapshot, we then compute the average stellar mass of the central galaxies in the main haloes. Finally, we

Finally, we calcu - late the diﬀerence of the average central galaxy stellar mas s between two subsequent snapshots and divide this by the time that has elapsed between those snapshots to derive the 10B.

The dashed l ines show the ‘true’ SMFs, before observational mass error i s added. average stellar mass growth rate of the central galaxies. By doing this for a set of trees in halo mass bins, we can com- pute the average growth rate as a function of the z= 0 halo mass and redshift. In the left panels of Figure 7 we show the average frac- tion ofz= 0 mass assembled as a fu
e average frac- tion ofz= 0 mass assembled as a function of redshift for dark matter haloes and central galaxies. For four z= 0 halo masses, the assembly history of a central galaxy is compared to that of its parent halo. In low-mass systems with log( Mvir/M⊙)∼<12.5 the halo grows much slower than its central galaxy. This indicates that in these systems the growth is dominated by internal gas physical processes such as cooling and star formation. Only rather little external material is falling i
 Only rather little external material is falling into the halo. For massive systems with log(Mvir/M⊙)∼>12.5 the trends are opposite at low red- shift: the fractional growth of haloes since z∼2 is much stronger than the stellar growth of their central galaxy. Alarge fraction of the stellar mass of massive galaxies is al- ready in place at z∼<2. In these massive systems the growth is dominated by external processes at late times, as they are accreting large amounts of material. While the halo grow

While the halo grows rapidly, the central galaxy does not, as most of the accreted systems take a very long time to reach the centre of the halo and instead survive to z= 0 as ‘satellite’ members of the group or cluster. To further study when most of the stellar and halo mass was in place we follow and extend the analysis by Conroy & Wechsler (2009). We plot the average assembly redshift of main haloes and central galaxies as a function of z= 0 mass in the right pa
alaxies as a function of z= 0 mass in the right panel of Figure 7. We show the red- shift at which 25, 50, and 75 per cent of the present stellar and halo mass was already in place. In low-mass systems, the stellar mass assembled much later than the halo mass. For a system with Mvir= 1012M⊙, half of the stellar mass Galactic star formation and accretion histories 11 Figure 7.

In more massive systems haloes assemble later while galax- ies assemble earlier: for a system with a z= 0 halo mass ofMvir= 1013M⊙, half of the halo has assembled onl
ofMvir= 1013M⊙, half of the halo has assembled only by redshift z= 1.0, but half of the stellar mass was already in place by redshift z= 1.8. Very massive galaxies in haloes with Mvir= 1014M⊙ show a very interesting behavior: while they begin to form very early and have 25 per cent of their stellar mass in place already byredshift z= 3.0, it takes them a long time tofully assemble. Half of their stellar mass is in place only by red- shiftz= 1.6, while 75 per cent is assembled by z= 0.3. The ﬁnal
while 75 per cent is assembled by z= 0.3. The ﬁnalz= 0 stellar mass is then assembled very quickly. The reason why these massive galaxies grow very fast at early times, only grow slowly at intermediate redshifts and grow fast again at late times can be found in the two processes that contribute to the growth of galaxies. At high redshift, a massive galaxy grows eﬀectively by star formation, while at low redshift, stellar accretion leads to a fast growth. At intermediate redshift however, neither
 growth. At intermediate redshift however, neither of these processes is eﬀective, so that the galaxy grows only very slowly. In the following section we aim to constrain and separate these two processes. Note that while massive galaxies assemble their ﬁnal stellar mass only late, the stars in these galaxies have formed much earlier, such that this result is not in conﬂict with the observation that the stars in massive systems are older than stars in low-mass galaxies. 4.1 Star formation and acc
s in low-mass galaxies. 4.1 Star formation and accretion histories The stellar mass of a galaxy can grow either by star forma- tion inside the galaxy (in-situ) or by the assembly of starsthat formed outside the galaxy and have been accreted later (ex-situ). In principle, both processes can contribute sim ul- taneously to the growth of a central galaxy, but in practice oneprocess will dominateovertheotheras afunction ofhalo mass and redshift. In order to separate the contributions from star forma
rder to separate the contributions from star formation and accretion, we have ﬁrst to deter- mine the amount of accretion of subhaloes onto the central object in the halo. Using our model, we can then populate these subhaloes with satellite galaxies and compute the ste l- lar accretion rate. Finally, the SFR can be determined from the diﬀerence between the total growth rate and the accre- tion rate. We use the same set of dark matter halo merger trees as before, i.e. we use all trees with a comm
trees as before, i.e. we use all trees with a common z= 0 virial mass of the main halo and assign a stellar mass to all haloes and subhaloes using our redshift-dependent SHM relation. For every simulation snapshot, we then record all satellite galaxies that are accreted onto the central galaxy until the time of the next snapshot. We note, that, by construction, this also includes orphan galaxies. At each snapshot we then sum the stellar mass of all recorded merging galaxies and divide this by th
ll recorded merging galaxies and divide this by the number of central galaxies in the sam- ple (which corresponds to the number of merger trees). We further assume that a fraction of satellite stars fesc= 0.2 escapes from the central galaxy and ends up in the halo as diﬀuse stellar material not detected in standard surveys . This ﬁducial value is motivated by high-resolution simu- lations of binary galaxy mergers (e.g. Nipoti et al. 2003; Naab & Burkert 2003; Moster et al. 2011). For a diﬀerent 
Burkert 2003; Moster et al. 2011). For a diﬀerent value the resulting stellar accretion and star formation ra tes change accordingly (e.g. for fesc= 0 the accretion rates are 25 per cent higher). In this way we get the average stellar 12B. P. Moster et al. Figure 8. Star formation and accretion histories for diﬀerent z= 0 halo masses.

In the ﬁrst two rows the black lines and shaded ar eas represent the rates that have been derived with our model and their 1 σconﬁdence levels. The red lines are ﬁts to these relation as g iven by equations (17)-(20) and (21)-(23). The blue line in the ﬁrst row shows the stellar mass loss rate.

The dotted lines in the fourth row indi cate that 50, 10 and 1 per cent of the stellar mass has formed ex -situ. accretion rate onto the central galaxy as a function of the z= 0 halo mass and redshift. Having determined the total stellar growth rate and the amount of growth that is due to 
owth rate and the amount of growth that is due to accretion, the SFR of an av- erage galaxy can be computed from the residual stellar mass growth attributed to star formation. However, the relation between this residual growth rate and the SFR is compli- cated by mass loss due to dying stars: dmres dt=dmtot dt−dmacc dt=dmSF dt−dmloss dt=dmIS dt.(15) This equation states that the residual growth rate d mres/dt,which is deﬁned as the diﬀerence between the total growth rate dmtot/dtand the accretio
een the total growth rate dmtot/dtand the accretion rate d macc/dt, is given by the diﬀerence between the SFR d mSF/dtand the stellar mass loss rate d mloss/dt, and corresponds to a net in-situ growth rate d mIS/dt. It can be solved iteratively, starting with a SFR that is equal to the residual growth rate at every epoch. We go to the time of the ﬁrst snapshot and compute the amount of stellar mass that is formed in an average galaxy. Then we move to the second snapshot and compute both the stel
e to the second snapshot and compute both the stellar mass that forms at this time and the stellar mass that is lost in the population that formed in the ﬁrst Galactic star formation and accretion histories 13 snapshot. For the latter we employ the formula floss(t) = 0.05×ln/parenleftbiggt+3×105yr 3×105yr/parenrightbigg ,(16) wherefloss(t) is the fraction of mass lost by a stellar popula- tion with an age t. This formula is a ﬁt to the mass loss of a stellar population with a Chabrier (2003) IMF
of a stellar population with a Chabrier (2003) IMF as developed by Bruzual & Charlot (2003) and implies that 40 per cent of stellar mass is lost within 1 Gyr and 50 per cent of stellar mass is lost within 10 Gyr. We then move to the third snapshot, compute the stel- lar mass that forms at this time and derive the stellar mass that is lost in the populations that formed in the ﬁrst and second snapshots. This procedure is continued until z= 0, while at every snapshot the amount of lost stellar mas
e at every snapshot the amount of lost stellar mass is the sum of the lost mass of all populations that have formed untilthen.Wecanthencomputetheloss ratebetweensubse- quentsnapshots and the in-situ growth rate as the diﬀerence between SFR and loss rate. This in-situ growth rate is then compared to the residual growth rate as described by equa- tion 15. The diﬀerence between those rates is then added to the SFR (separately at each snapshot) and the procedure is repeated and iterated until the in
he procedure is repeated and iterated until the in-situ growth rate and the residual growth rate are equal. We repeat this procedure for each sample of halo merger trees with a given z= 0 halo mass. The resulting SFRs and accretion rates are shown in the ﬁrst and second rows of Figure 8 (black solid lines), respectively, for four diﬀerent z= 0 halo masses. The 1 σ conﬁdence levels for both rates (shaded areas) have been computed by employing the upper and lower estimates for mean stellar masses 
upper and lower estimates for mean stellar masses according toour SHM relation. We have also added the stellar mass loss rates in upper panels (blue line). All results represent the average rates, i.e. the ave rage of both red and blue galaxies at a given z= 0 halo mass. Of course, individual galaxies can have higher or lower SFRs depending on other galaxy properties like color, so that blu e (red) galaxies can have higher (lower) SFRs. We ﬁnd that the star formation history of central galax- ie
at the star formation history of central galax- ies peaks at a certain redshift. This peak SFR redshift de- pends on halo mass: for massive systems this peak occurs at high redshift ( z= 3 for Mvir= 1014M⊙) while for lower masses the SFR peaks at a lower redshift ( z= 0.5 forMvir= 1012M⊙). For systems with an even lower mass ofMvir∼<1011.7M⊙the peak has not been reached yet by z= 0. After the peak has been reached, the SFR quickly drops, such that massive galaxies are quenched at z∼2. Furthermor
t massive galaxies are quenched at z∼2. Furthermore, the peak SFR is higher in more massive sys- tems. We also ﬁnd that in systems that are more massive thanMvir= 1012.5M⊙, the stellar mass loss rate due to dy- ing stars is larger than the SFR at z= 0, such that the mass of stars present in the central galaxy is decreasing. The accretion rates increase with time for all systems. Massive systems have a high accretion rate that dominates the total growth rate at late times, while for low-mass sys-
growth rate at late times, while for low-mass sys- tems, accretion is insigniﬁcant at all times. For a system withMvir= 1014M⊙the accretion rate dominates over the SFRatz <1. The halo mass at which the accretion rate and the SFR are equal at z= 0 isMvir= 1012.7M⊙. For lower masses the contribution of accretion to the total growth rat e quickly drops. The reason why accretion contributes signif - icantly to the overall growth in massive systems and it isinsigniﬁcant in low-mass systems can be inf
d it isinsigniﬁcant in low-mass systems can be inferred from the SHM relation. Massive haloes host relatively massive sub- haloes, and these subhaloes are ﬁlled with relatively massi ve satellite galaxies. The subhaloes that have e.g. one tenth o f the main halo mass host galaxies that are almost as massive as the central galaxy, so that the resulting accretion rates are high. In low-mass systems, however, the subhaloes are almost entirely devoid of stars, so that the accretion of the subhaloes 
 of stars, so that the accretion of the subhaloes onto the center does not result in a signiﬁcant stellar accretion rate. Moreover, Figure 7 shows that low- mass haloes have largely assembled by z= 1, so that any late time growth has to come from star formation. To compare further the relative importance of star for- mationandaccretionforsystemsofdiﬀerentmass,weplotin the third row of Figure 8 the amount of stellar mass that has formed in-situ, i.e. through star formation, and the amount that ha
.e. through star formation, and the amount that has formed ex-situ, i.e. has been accreted. In the fourt h row we show the fraction of stellar mass of the central galaxy that has formed ex-situ. In massive systems with Mvir/greaterorequalslant1013M⊙, all of the stars that have formed in-situ and survived were already in place at high redshift ( z∼>2). Al- though, the loss rate is higher than the accretion rate at lat e times, and the amount of in-situ stellar mass has decreased sincez∼2, the tot
-situ stellar mass has decreased sincez∼2, the total stellar mass of the system increases with time, as the accretion rate compensates for the lost stellar mass. In very massive systems with Mvir= 1014M⊙ more than half of the central stellar mass is formed ex-situ. In lower mass systems the amount of ex-situ stellar mass is decreasing considerably: for Mvir= 1013M⊙the fraction of ex-situ stars is 20 per cent, for Mvir= 1012M⊙the frac- tion is 2 per cent, and for Mvir= 1012M⊙the fraction is 1 per
er cent, and for Mvir= 1012M⊙the fraction is 1 per cent. At high redshift ( z∼>2), the amount of stellar mass that has formed ex-situ is negligible for systems of all masses. We further note that the accretion rates grow more rapidly in massive systems than in systems of low mass. The connection between star formation and accretion history and the virial mass of the system can be of general use in constraining models of cooling, star formation and feedback in galaxies. These relations have been 
d feedback in galaxies. These relations have been derived en- tirely from observations with an empirical model. Although this model makes no reference to the physical processes that drivethe evolution of galaxies, it can be veryhelpful in ord er to constrain more physical models. In order to easily com- pare our model predictions to the results of other models such as simulations and semi-analytic models, we provide simple ﬁtting functions to the star formation and accretion histories. We ﬁnd th
 star formation and accretion histories. We ﬁnd that at a given z= 0 main halo mass the SFR is well ﬁt by the relation: dmSF dt(z) =f1af2exp/parenleftbiggf2 f3(1.0−a)/parenrightbigg =f1(1+z)−f2exp/parenleftbiggf2 f3z 1+z/parenrightbigg . (17) The parameters f1,f2, andf3depend on the z= 0 halo 14B. P. Moster et al. mass of the system and follow the relations: f1=f10exp/parenleftbigg −(log(Mvir/M⊙)−f11)2 2f2 12/parenrightbigg ,(18) f2=f20+f21log/parenleftbiggMvir 1012M⊙/parenrightbigg , (19) log(f

(20) The parameter f1can be interpreted as the SFR at z= 0, f2is the slope of the star formation history at high redshift, andf3corresponds to the expansion factor aof the peak SFR. The values of the ﬁtting parameters are: f10= 2.658M⊙yr−1,f11= 11.937,f12= 0.424, f20= 5.507, f21= 2.437, f30=−0.915, f31= 0.696,f32=−0.159. The SFRs obtained with this ﬁtting function are compared totheinferred
th this ﬁtting function are compared totheinferred ones in Figure 8(red lines). Overall theglob al ﬁt is very close to the model predictions. For very massive galaxies with Mvir= 1014M⊙at low redshift ( z <1), the ﬁtting function is lower than the model SFR, although it is still within the 1 σconﬁdence levels. The accretion history for systems of a given z= 0 main halo mass can be described with an exponential dependence on redshift: dmacc dt(z) =g1exp/parenleftbigg −z g2/parenrightbigg . (21) T
=g1exp/parenleftbigg −z g2/parenrightbigg . (21) The parameters g1, andg2are functions of the z= 0 halo mass of the system and are given by: g1=g10/bracketleftbigg/parenleftbiggMvir 1012.5M⊙/parenrightbiggg11 +/parenleftbiggMvir 1012.5M⊙/parenrightbiggg12/bracketrightbigg−1 ,(22) g2=g20+g21/parenleftbiggMvir 1012M⊙/parenrightbiggg22 . (23) The parameter g1gives the stellar accretion rate at z= 0, andg2is the slope of the accretion history. The values of the ﬁtting parameters are: g10= 1.633M⊙yr−
lues of the ﬁtting parameters are: g10= 1.633M⊙yr−1,g11=−2.017,g12=−0.806, g20= 0.855, g21= 0.098, g22=−0.797. The accretion rates obtained with this ﬁtting function are compared to the inferred ones in Figure 8 (red lines). The global ﬁtis veryclose tothemodelprdictions for all redshi fts and halo masses. 4.2 Cosmic star formation rate density In order to check whether our model SFRs are in agree- ment with observational constraints, we compare our model prediction for the evolution of the cosm
our model prediction for the evolution of the cosmic SFR density to data in the literature. For this we compute the SFR for each halo in the simulations using our recipe as given by equations (17)-(20) and compute the volume density for each snapshot. We compare the result to observa- tional estimates derived with diﬀerent methods in Figure 9. This comparison includes estimates derived from the UV (Salim et al. 2007; van der Burg et al. 2010; Bouwens et al. 2009; Robotham & Driver 2011; Bouwens

Our model is in excellent agreement with the data at all redshifts. We note that our model was only constrained with observed SMFs at diﬀerent redshifts and has not been ﬁt to observed SFRs. This means that the observed SMFs are broadly consistent with observational inferences for SFRs once observational mass er
nal inferences for SFRs once observational mass errors are takenintoaccount. More - over, this shows that our choice for the parameterization fo r the redshift-dependent SHM relation is consistent with ob- servational constraints, and that our inferred recipe for t he mass-dependent star formation histories gives reliable es ti- mates. 4.3 Speciﬁc star formation rates As afurther test whether our model predictions are in agree- ment within the observational limits, we compute the spe- ciﬁc star

Observationally,itis verydiﬃculttoinfertheSSFRa s afunctionofthe z= 0stellar mass sinceobservations cannot connect galaxies at diﬀerent epochs.

However, it is possible to derive the average SSFR for galaxies within a stellar mass range at diﬀerent redshift

We can compare these observational data to the predictions of our model, by populating all haloes in a given snapshot with galaxies us- ing our SHM relation to get stellar masses and our recipe for the star formation history to get their SFR. We show this comparison for low-mass galaxies with log( m∗/Mvir) = 9.5 in Figure 10 and for massive galaxies log( m∗/Mvir) = 10.5 in Figure 11.

For both stellar mass ranges, our model is in excellent agreement with thedata, although this relation has not

This shows that mass-dependent quantities, such as the SSFR can be predicted up to high redshift in addition to global quantities such as the cosmic SFR density. As our model is able to ﬁt a wide range of observed data, we are conﬁdent that it can be used to estimate reliably relations that cannot be easily observed, such as the star formation history of an average galaxy as a function its z= 0 halo mass. 5 DISCUSSION In this study we dr

Further- more, our analysis conﬁrms the results of De Lucia et al.

Although star formation ceases at low redshift for mas- sive systems, the stellar mass of their cent

Th e majority ofthese ex-situstars haveformed when their galax - ies still were centrals, i.e. before they entered the main halo. Therefore massive galaxies consist of old stellar pop - ulations. On the other hand, massive galaxies start to as- semble very early due to star formation, but their ﬁnal mass is assembled only very late. Employing semi-analytic mod- els, De Lucia

Employing semi-analytic mod- els, De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) ﬁnd that half of the mass of central galaxies of very massive haloes with Mvir= 1015M⊙ forms after z∼4, but is locked up in the central galaxy only afterz= 0.5. This is in good agreement with our results: extrapolating the 50 per cent assembly redshift in Figure 7 toMvir= 1015M⊙roughly yields z= 0.5. Our model indicates that low-mass (massive) galaxies form late (early), although their dark matter haloes assem- ble early (late). 
their dark matter haloes assem- ble early (late). Although the haloes of low-mass galaxies assembles early it takes a considerable amount of time for the gas to cool and fall to the centre and form stars. In massive systems, on the other hand, the central galaxies (and the galaxies that will become satellites in these sys- tems) can start to grow very early and form the bulk of their stars at high redshift. However, their haloes assembl e only late, and the satellites are accreted onto the centr
te, and the satellites are accreted onto the central galaxies at low redshift. Therefore, the stellar populatio ns of massive galaxies are old, although massive haloes assem- ble late. This demonstrates that ‘downsizing’ is not anti- hierarchical, but a consequence of the bottom-up ΛCDM scenario (Neistein et al. 2006; Fontanot et al. 2009). The contribution of star formation and accretion to the total stellar growth of central galaxies depends both on hal o mass and redshift. While at high redsh

The halo mass at which both pro- cesses contribute equally to the total growth of the central galaxy at z= 0 is log( Mvir/M⊙)∼12.7, which corresponds to a stellar mass of log( m/M⊙)∼10.9. Here, both modes add∼1M⊙yr−1to the stellar mass of the galaxy. This is in good agreement with the results of Guo & White (2008) who employ a semi-a

At z= 0 they ﬁnd that the stellar mass of cen- tral galaxies for which both processes contribute equally i s roughly log( m/M⊙)∼10.6, with rates of ∼0.5−1M⊙yr−1 (see their Figure 3). For systems of lower (higher) mass, both methods indicate a lower (higher) contribution of ex- situ stars. At z= 2 the semi-analytic model predicts that the 
At z= 2 the semi-analytic model predicts that the stellar mass of galaxies with an equal contribution of the two processes is roughly log( m/M⊙)∼11.0, with rates of∼20M⊙yr−1, while in our model only the most massive galaxies with log( m/M⊙)∼>11.4 have accretion rates that are comparable to their SFRs. In the present study on average 50 per cent of the stars in galaxies in massive haloes (1014M⊙) atz= 0 are made in external galaxies and accreted at later epochs. However, in lower mass haloes, lik

sim ulations agree well with the predicted conversion eﬃciency at z= 0, most have too high values at earlier epochs, indicating t hat they form their stars too early. this fraction is only a few per cent, making stellar accre- tion relatively unimportant for the evolution of the centra l galaxies. This in accord with standard formation and enrich - mentscenarios for diskgalaxies (Matteucci & Francois 1989 ; Mo et al. 1998; Prantzos & Silk 1998; Naab & Ostriker 2006; Kauﬀmann et al. 2012). Simila
aab & Ostriker 2006; Kauﬀmann et al. 2012). Similar trends are reported from three-dimensional cos- mological hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations, however, with larger fractions of accreted stars for galaxies of all masses. For the most massive galaxies this can be up to 80 per cent (Oser et al. 2010; Feldmann et al. 2010). Still, it is likely that this fraction is reduced to 50 percent (in the same mass bin) by the inclusion of strong stellar feed- back which reduces the stellar content of the (
d- back which reduces the stellar content of the (typically low er mass) accreted galaxies (Hirschmann et al. 2012). In zoom- in simulations individual stellar particles can directly b e fol- lowed and it has been shown that ex-situ stars predomi- nantly assemble at larger radii (e.g. Laporte et al. 2012). In massive spheroidal galaxies, where the fraction of ex- situ stars is high, this material plays a signiﬁcant role in the structural evolution of the galaxies (Naab et al. 2009; Hopkins et al
n of the galaxies (Naab et al. 2009; Hopkins et al. 2009; Feldmann et al. 2010; Oser et al. 2010, 2012). In lower-mass disk-like galaxies the accreted stars contribute to the build-up of the outer stellar halo and can also directlycontributeontheorder of10percenttotheste l-lar mass of the disk (e.g. Abadi et al. 2006; Font et al. 2011; Tissera et al. 2012). Interestingly, these simulations pre dict ex-situ fractions of more than ∼20 per cent (up to 40-50 per cent) which is an order of magnitude 
to 40-50 per cent) which is an order of magnitude higher then found in our study. Our model constrains the mass budget of cosmological galaxy formation simulations not only at the present day but also at higher redshift. We compare our model to the results of hydrodynamical zoom-in simulations and semi- analytic models at six redshifts in Figure 12. While some older simulations havetoo high conversion eﬃciencies at z= 0, most of the newer simulations show good agreement with theeﬃcienciesneededt
ions show good agreement with theeﬃcienciesneededtoreproducethelocalobservedSMFs. However, almost all simulations have far too high eﬃciencie s at earlier epochs. This indicates that these simulations fo rm too many stars early ( z∼3), while at late times ( z∼<2) star formation is quenched too strongly, so that most of the stellar mass at z= 0 is already present at high redshift. The lack of late star formation in simulations could possibl y explain the diﬃculties in gettingprominent discs. Most
ain the diﬃculties in gettingprominent discs. Most sta rs are formed at times where processes leadingtotheformation of spheroids are common, e.g. major mergers or spin ﬂips (Sales et al. 2011; Okamoto 2012). If the majority of stars form after these epochs, a more prominent disc forms. The results of the semi-analytic models agree very well Galactic star formation and accretion histories 17 with our relation at z= 0. This is not surprising as these models were tuned to ﬁt the local SMF. At highe
se models were tuned to ﬁt the local SMF. At higher redshift however, their predictions diﬀer from our model, indicatin g as noted in the original papers that they do not yield good ﬁts to the observed high redshift SMFs. While the normal- ization and the slopes are in good agreement with our rela- tion, the halo mass where the eﬃciency peaks ( M1), moves to lower masses with increasing redshift. We note that a direct comparison between stellar masses measured in simulations and observed stellar
asses measured in simulations and observed stellar masses is diﬃcult. Especially at high redshift, it is complicated t o estimate stellar masses observationally, as many diﬀerent eﬀects have to be taken into account. Moreover, one has to make a number of assumptions when ﬁtting the spectral en- ergy distributions (SEDs). An alternative way to compare stellar masses in models and observations is bymakingmock images of simulated galaxies using a stellar populations sy n- thesis code and then obtai
ellar populations sy n- thesis code and then obtaining a ‘photometric’ stellar mass with an SED ﬁt. However there are two complications with this approach: First, it depends on the assumptions that are made to obtain the mock images (dust modeling, stellar populations synthesis modeling). Second, the reduction of the mock images would have to be done in the same way as for the observed data, which is non-trivial. Therefore we have decided to conduct a simpler comparison within the limits of the 
uct a simpler comparison within the limits of the quoted observational errors. The characteristic shape of the SHM relation is a consequence of several diﬀerent physical processes, that prevent the gas in the dark matter halo from cooling (or reheat cold gas) and forming stars. The contribution of each process varies for systems of diﬀerent mass. In low-mass systems, feedback from supernova-driven winds can be very eﬀective as winds can easily expel large amounts of gas from haloes with low esca
pel large amounts of gas from haloes with low escape velocities (e.g. Larson 1974; Dekel & Silk 1986; Oppenheimer & Dav´ e 2008; Puchwein & Springel 2012). Furthermore the amount of cooled gas is reduced by the presence of a UV and an X-ray background (Navarro & Steinmetz 1997; Gnedin 2000; Benson et al. 2002; Hambrick et al. 2011) and by cos- mic rays (Jubelgas et al. 2008; Wadepuhl & Springel 2011). These eﬀects have diﬀerent eﬃciencies for diﬀerent halo masses, such that the low-mass slope of
erent halo masses, such that the low-mass slope of the SHM relation can change at the halo mass, where the eﬃciencies of the two processes cross. However, with the current data it is very hard to ﬁnd this transition mass, as the error estimates are even larger than the possible variations in the slope. In massive haloes the star formation eﬃciency may be lowered by feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN Springel et al. 2005; Croton et al. 2006; Bower et al. 2006; Somerville et al. 2008; Hambr
; Bower et al. 2006; Somerville et al. 2008; Hambrick et al. 2011; Teyssier et al. 2011;Martizzi et al.2012;Puchwein & Springel2012)which can heat the gas in the halo and prevent it from cool- ing. Another eﬀect that may be important for massive galaxies is gravitational heating (Khochfar & Ostriker 200 8; Johansson et al. 2009). In hydrodynamical zoom-in simu- lations this eﬀect is naturally included and results in a trend of lower galaxy formation eﬃciencies for more mas- sive haloes, although
ion eﬃciencies for more mas- sive haloes, although still at levels which are signiﬁcantl y too high (Oser et al. 2010; Hirschmann et al. 2012). In this framework, thecharacteristic halomass forwhichgalaxyfo r- mation is most eﬃcient is the mass where the combination of the various physical processes that reduce the eﬃciencyis minimal. For massive galaxies the amount of in-situ stars is aﬀected largely by processes that are eﬀective for more massive systems (AGN feedback and gravitational heating
ve systems (AGN feedback and gravitational heating), while the amount of ex-situ stars is strongly aﬀected by pro- cesses that are eﬀective for systems of lower mass (such as SN feedback and an ionizing background radiation). Although the only observational constraints of our model are the observed SMFs from z= 0 to 4, our predic- tions for the evolution of the cosmic SFR density are in very good agreement with direct observation. This indicates tha t the evolution of the SMFs is consistent with
tha t the evolution of the SMFs is consistent with the evolution of the cosmic SFR density, although the integrated observed SFR density was previously found to be higher than the ob- served stellar mass density (e.g. Hopkins & Beacom 2006). There are two eﬀects that help to reconcile this tension. First, we employ the recent measurements by S12, who ﬁnd a considerably steeper low-mass slope for the SMFs. This results in a larger amount of stellar mass in the low-mass end and thus increases the 
r mass in the low-mass end and thus increases the observed stellar mass density. Second, we include the eﬀects of observational mass error in our model. As a consequence we ﬁnd an evolution in the high-mass end of the ‘true’ SMFs, especially at low red- shift. When both eﬀects are taken into account, the tension between the evolution of the stellar mass density and the integrated SFR density is considerably lowered. 6 SUMMARY In this paper, we present a galaxy evolution model that as- sumes a ti
esent a galaxy evolution model that as- sumes a tight relation between the stellar mass of a galaxy and the mass of the dark matter halo in which it resides. With this approach we populate haloes with galaxies over the entire cosmic period from z∼4 to the present, using the N-body Millennium simulations and observed SMFs. Unlike theclassical abundancematchingtechniqueour newmethod is self-consistent, taking into account that subhaloes are ac- creted at earlier times and with higher masses than w
ted at earlier times and with higher masses than when they are observed. We employ a redshift-dependent param- eterization of the stellar-to-halo mass relation, and popu - late haloes and subhaloes with galaxies requiring that the observed SMFs at diﬀerent redshifts be reproduced simulta- neously. We show that when observational mass errors are not taken into account, no consistent stellar mass evolution of massive galaxies can be obtained, as the central galaxy of a typical halo of mass Mvir= 1
e central galaxy of a typical halo of mass Mvir= 1014M⊙would lose ∼25 per cent of its stellar mass from z= 1 to 0. When we include observational mass errors, this tension vanishes and massi ve galaxies also have a physically consistent stellar mass evo - lution. We ﬁnd that the halo mass where galaxy formation is most eﬃcient is log( Mvir/M⊙)∼11.8 atz= 0 and in- creases with increasing redshift to log( Mvir/M⊙)∼12.5 at z= 4. Thus at high redshift, the peak eﬃciency of convert- ing baryons into s
, the peak eﬃciency of convert- ing baryons into stars occurs in more massive haloes. The normalization of the SHM ratio decreases with increasing redshift: While at z= 0 the most eﬃcient haloes have con- verted∼23 per cent of their baryons into stars, at z= 4 the peak eﬃciency is less than ∼10 per cent. We further compare our results to those of hydrody- namical zoom-in simulations and semi-analytic models and ﬁnd that most of the newer models show good agreement 18B. P. Moster et al. with the 
how good agreement 18B. P. Moster et al. with the eﬃciencies needed to reproduce the local observed SMFs. However, almost all have eﬃciencies which are far too high at earlier epochs, indicating that they form their stars too early. At late times star formation is quenched, so that most of the stellar mass today is already present at high redshift. In the semi-analytic models the normalization an d the slopes of the SHM relation are in good agreement with ours, but the halo mass where the eﬃcien
ment with ours, but the halo mass where the eﬃciency peaks moves to lower rather than to higher masses with increasing redshift . We then combine our relation with merger trees ex- tracted from the simulations in order to predict the mean assembly histories of the stellar mass components within dark matter haloes (in situ and ex situ formation). We av- erage over a sample of haloes with the same mass at z= 0, such that our model yields the average stellar mass growth of central galaxies as a fun
e stellar mass growth of central galaxies as a function of halo mass. We ﬁnd that in low-mass systems the halo grows much more slowly than its central galaxy. For a system with Mvir= 1012M⊙, half of the stellar mass of the central galaxy forms after redshif t z= 0.7 while half of the virial mass was already assembled byz= 1.3. For massive systems the trends are opposite at low redshift: the fractional growth of haloes is much strong er than stellar growth, while a large fraction of the stellar m
ar growth, while a large fraction of the stellar ma ss of massive galaxies is already in place early. For a system withMvir= 1012M⊙, half of the halo has assembled only byz= 1.0, but half of the stellar mass was already in place byz= 1.8. In very massive haloes with Mvir= 1012M⊙the galaxies start to form very early with 25 per cent of their stellar mass in place already by z= 3.0. However, it takes them a long time to fully assemble: Half of their stellar mass is in place only by z= 1.6, while 7
r stellar mass is in place only by z= 1.6, while 75 per cent of the stellar mass is in place by z= 0.3. We then go further and identify the progenitors of a given halo at earlier epochs and derive the amount of stel- lar mass that has been accreted onto the central galaxy. Employing a recipe to account for mass loss from individual stars, wethencomputethestellar mass thathasbeenformed through star formation and convert this into a SFR. In this way we derive the SFR history as a function of halo 
y we derive the SFR history as a function of halo mass. We ﬁnd that the star formation history of central galaxies peaks at a certain redshift which depends on halo mass: for massive systems the peak occurs at high redshift while for low-mass systems it has not yet been reached by z= 0. Af- ter the peak has been reached, the SFR quickly drops, such that massive galaxies are quenched at z∼2. On the other hand, the stellar accretion rates increase with time for all systems. Massive systems have a 
with time for all systems. Massive systems have a high stellar accretion rate that dominates the total growth rate at late times, while for low-mass systems, accretion is insigniﬁcant at all times. T he halo mass at which the accretion rate and the SFR are equal atz= 0 is log( Mvir/M⊙)∼12.7. Finally we demonstrate that our inferred SFR histories are in agreement with observation. We compute the SFR for all systems in the simulation and derive the evolution of the cosmic SFR density. Moreover we

Weﬁndthatour choice for the parameterization of the redshift-dependent SHM relation is consistent with observational constraints , and that our inferred recipe for the mass dependent star formation histories gives reliable estimates.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We thank Alyson Brooks, Shy Genel, Fabio Governato, Qi Guo, Cheng Li, Takashi Okamoto, Ludwig Oser, Paola San- tini, Cecilia Scannapi
